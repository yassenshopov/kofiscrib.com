An almost compulsory part of any self-care blog or YouTube series is the (im)famous morning routine.  And you know the drill, it usually includes a combination of the following:

1. Cold shower

2. Black coffee

3. Walk in the park

4. Journaling

5. Meditation

And although they are all great practices, doing them all, consistently, every single day in the part of the day when you’re arguably the most sleepy, is difficult. So people tend to get discouraged and don’t even try anymore.

However, I have found that in my personal experience, a complicated multi-step morning routine really isn’t useful in the long term. In this article, I will show you the quick and simple way I start my day, with which I get all the benefits of a complicated morning routine. And of course, [we are going to use my favorite app, Notion](https://kofiscrib.com/blog/creative-virgo/notion), for the task. 

## Data entry
**Data entry** is a practice I have started doing since the beginning of 2021. It is one of the easiest ways to start your morning, and it comes down to observing your habits and keeping them in check.

The database I am using is the one in the image, and is is all in all just a table of all the dates of 2021 in chronological order. You can do the same thing in Excel and any other database app. Each row is a single day, and the different properties are:

- The hour and minute I woke up

- The hour and minute I fell asleep

- The deep sleep percentage

- Whether I will work out today

- Whether I will meditate today

- How many coffees I had today

- My weight in kg in the morning

- Any daily comments and notes I have

If you are wondering about the abundance of sleep data, it is especially easy to track if you have a fitness band or a smartwatch. Some of them are not really that expensive as well, so it is really a worthwhile investment for the money you’re paying.

Now, onto the benefits.

Among the many benefits of this practice (sitting down in the morning and evening for 5 minutes to log all this), I have found the biggest one to be at a larger timescale. Once a few months of this had passed, I **had gathered a lot of data**, enough for me to start noticing trends. I started connecting my daily coffee intake to the quality of sleep I get, which by extension relates to my gym performance the same day. Sleep is also affected by other factors, such as stress, so I started noticing that the times I felt most stressed were pretty much determined by my Uni schedule. And now that I know in advance that I will be busier in the middle of the semester, I can better arrange my schedule around that time to allow for more rest and self-care.

Another benefit I have found for myself is **keeping the streak going** has helped my motivation and discipline. The act of checking your progress every morning and adding new checkmarks is a positive feedback cycle. The more you go to the gym, the more checkmarks you see on the table, the longer the streak becomes, and then you want to make it longer, so you go to the gym again and again. It’s a really simple philosophy, but it is an effective one.

## Reflection
This one is very closely related to the previous one, and it is so natural and straightforward that many people would not even count it as a separate practice. After you have finished logging your daily data, you should go back to your weekly, monthly, and even yearly data.

Are the general trends in your sleep, weight, gym performance, leading in a positive direction? Do you think you are on a plateau, on the rise or on a decline? Can you do something right now, this very day, to get back on track?

It is helpful to have goals, but ultimately, it is the systems we set that will lead us to those goals. You should keep in mind that we often overestimate what we can get done in a day, but underestimate what we can get done in a year’s worth of time. Keep track of your weekly and monthly goals, make routine reviews, and you will notice how it is no longer so difficult to stay on track.

## Plan ahead. Or not?
Many people want to make “planning” a part of their morning routine. Or, maybe they don’t want to be planning the day from the morning, but it just feels most natural to do so.

However, I’d argue that it is not a good idea to make your plan for the day in the morning of the same day. It may seem reasonable, but it is a much more error-prone process than expected. For one, you are losing valuable morning energy by simply ordering your tasks in your calendar, and two, you are losing the opportunity to start the day by **doing** something. Instead, you are just **planning** to do this “something”.

So what am I suggesting?

I suggest you end your day with the planning of the next one, as sleepy as you may be. If you can, even, plan ahead most of your tasks on Sunday for the following week, and readjust during the week. Feel free to always change things up, as our schedule should not be this fixed, rigid thing, it should be flowier and serve as a guideline for how we live our lives.

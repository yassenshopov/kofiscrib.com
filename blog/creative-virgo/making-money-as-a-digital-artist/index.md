It would be just so easy if money didn’t exist - we’d all be drawing, doing crafts, learning languages, and chilling with each other all day long. Sadly, money exists, and we need a bunch of it to keep going. But while it may seem counter-intuitive to use your very craft to generate income, so you could have more time to create more art, this is just the scenario I’m following. As I’ve argued in some of my other blog posts, there is a niche for every style, for every form of creative output actually. This normally means that there is also someone to support you by buying your artwork or giving you money in any manner. Below, you’ll see a list of ways you can monetize your artwork, the ways they are different from each other, and some ideas that I’m yet to test myself, but I believe hold potential

## 1. Commissions

This is my main source of artistic income, and this is the case for many other digital artists as well. A commission is a paid artwork and is to be customized to the client’s liking. In my specific case, since I specialize in character design, this means I can draw somebody’s original character, draw a new profile picture for them, draw them and/or a friend in my style, draw fanart of their favorite characters, and so on! The functions are quite versatile, and artists are quite flexible, so one client’s commission will probably be quite different from another client’s.

## 2. Patreon

Patreon is a crowdfunding platform, where people can support you in creating your unique artwork on a monthly basis. Just for a few dollars, for example, my Patrons can get access to exclusive content, early access to new drawings, can vote on what the next drawings will be, and so on. Other people make their Patreons quite simpler, where people can just support them without too much of a reward, maybe a few exclusive artworks every now and then. In order to be successful on there (something I’m still trying to do), you need to be charismatic enough to get people to support you, and also to be able to provide some unique set of rewards for those people to appreciate. This is a form of passive income for many and becomes increasingly more popular. To see what my Patreon page looks like, [look no further](https://www.patreon.com/kofiscrib).

## 3. Ko-Fi tips

Ko-Fi resembles Patreon a bit, but there is no subscription required when you support an artist. You can buy a digital artist a “coffee“, by sending them a few bucks. I use this page as a “tip jar“ of sorts, wherein after a commission, if the client is happy, they can throw a few dollars my way via this tip jar.

## 4. RedBubble or Etsy Merch

Selling merchandise! This one is a classic, where if people would like to see and own your design on a physical medium, they can do so. RedBubble and Etsy are a bit different, with Etsy being just a site where orders can be processed, and you have to make, pack and send the product yourself, and RB is a print-on-demand site, where against a percent of the price, the RedBubble platform takes care of everything, from production to delivery, you just provide the design for the merchandise.

## 5. YouTube Ad revenue

This is a bit obvious, but it can be a bit difficult to get off the ground. If you have a YouTube channel with over 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch-time (or the opposite, don’t quote me on this), you will be able to monetize your channel and get a small amount of money each time somebody views an advertisement on one of your videos. I’ll probably be turning my attention to YouTube, but I’m still at the audience growing stage on Instagram, so that would wait. From what I know, this is quite a worthwhile pursuit, even if it takes years to get to the monetization stage.

## 6. Tutorials, Exclusive Content, PDFs

Now, this last idea is a bit more general and can be used on any of the above platforms. Artists inspire other artists, and like I’ve mentioned before, even a beginner can teach another beginner how to be a good beginner. A good tutorial can go great lengths, and these can also be monetized, not only on Patreon, but also on your own website, or on something like GumRoad, which is another digital product selling platform.

So the thing that connects all the dots is just being creative - not only with your content but with the ways you generate income!

There’s been a noticeable upward trend in the creator economy in recent years. More and more people raise their voices on different issues, and one of the topics that I find more and more content about every day is *productivity*.

The content can even get overwhelming for the average productivity-nerd, with so many new and old ideas blending together into one really efficient and a bit scary mess.
 
This is why I knew it was about time for this article to come to the rescue.

It happens very often that I want to recommend certain tactics or frameworks to my friends who aren’t as deep into the productivity spaces as I am, and it’s often a hard task to find the best video or article. Plainly, there are many YouTubers with different videos on the same topics. And it’s hard to choose a winner.

So if you fall under one of the following categories:

1. You’re a productivity nerd who wants to see if there’s a strategy/app/system they don’t know about

2. You’re a student/newcomer and you wonder where to get started

3. You want to explore a rich recommendation list of helpful topics

… then this is the article for you! I’ve divided all my recommendations into several categories, so go browse them all to find what interests you. All links are tested and are working, and they’ll lead you to articles, YouTube videos and channels, websites, and so on.

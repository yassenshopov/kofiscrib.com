With so many ideas floating in your head, and so much inspiration all around us, this should mean there is never a point at which we don’t have what to draw, right? I wish.

It is very easy to lose inertia when you’re running out of ideas, so I compiled a list of little and big concepts, which can evolve into whole themes to develop over a long period of time. Just remember - there is literally always something to draw, it just often isn’t the first thing on our minds.

## 1. Experiment with skills you need to work on!

Here you can combine content creation with the honing of your skills, which is very much necessary in order to grow artistically. For example, I was kinda struggling with anatomy, and I recently found some really good refeence pictures to draw inspiartion from, so I decided to convert this need for exercise into the Tokyo Ghoul series of 6 consectuive posts. The end result is a bunch of post-worthy content, plus some improvements in terms of body proportions and colour schemes. Some things you can make a series of posts on (while improving upon them) include: faces, poses, proportions, backgrounds, colour combinations, shadows and lighting, etc.

## 2. Try one of the numerous challenges like Inktober, Mermay, Huevember.
 
Each of these is specifically targeted to make you work on a particular set of themes for a longish period of time, and for you to practice the habit of daily drawing. Most people, me included, fail to maintain a 30-day streak, but it is the intetion that matters, and the learning potential is really vast. Shoot for the moon, and if you miss, you’d still be among the stars, as cliched as it sounds. You really don’t have to wait for the particular month to start in order to get the challenge going. The hashtags are mostly active throughout the year anyway, and I managed to generate quite some following by doing the Huevember challenge (made for November) in May, so don’t be intimitated.

## 3. Draw This In Your Style for the win!

This is a challenge that took off this year, and it is widely accessible, because anyone can make a cute drawing, label it as DTIYS, and you will get at least a few people drawing your concept in their unique style, which really works well for establishing a strong community around your art. Still, there is another side of this coin, when you find an artist you admire a lot, they most likely have such a challenge on their feed. This way you can improve your art by studying theirs, and you may even generate some new following, if the famous artist gets to boost your artpiece via a story. Plus, this never gets old, there are several artists that I follow that mainly do other people’s DTIYS challenges, and still manage to keep ot fresh and interesting.

## 4. Dedicate a week’s worth of daily posts to a fandom you love.

I have found in my experience that your following will have very differing tastes when it comes to the animes/shows they watch. By switching up with the fandoms you draw for, you up your chances at becoming a point of interest for them. There is never enough fanart in existence, I assure you, so the audience will always be hungry to see their faves reimagined in your unique style. Plus, you will get to scratch your inner (and overall) fan, and this can turn into you paying homage to the shows, characters and storylines that inspired you along the way to become the creator you are today.
 
## 5. Don’t wait for propmpts, go after ways to make fans happy!

Now this may sound like a very people-pleasing type of mentality, but what I really mean is that many big name artists at their prime can charge their clients very high prices for commissions, and for you to get to that point in your career, you may need to start off by creating art for free for your audience. Of course, don’t work for free when it would harm your current financial situation, but if you can afford the random freebie, for example to draw an illustration for a fanfiction you really liked, or just to reimagine a friend of yours in your style, go for it! When you have consistently and qualitively provided for your community, it will after some period of time be more than willing to support you as the person who brought them joy intentionally. This is a more long-term growth strategy, but it can and should be implemented today, if you want to reap the benefits later.

Those were my top 5 types of art concepts I go to when I wonder what to draw next, apart from commission work! Share yours in the comments, thank you for the support! ^^

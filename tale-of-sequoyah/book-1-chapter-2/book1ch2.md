# BOOK 1: The Beginning
## Chapter 2: The Ritual

By the time the two warriors returned to their village, the ritual had already begun. 

The elders were gathered together in a big circle, enclosing a small wooden idol doll between them. The djembe drums started making their low and numb sounds, spicing the atmosphere of the ritual a little bit. A subtle melody arose among the men in the circle, their eyes closed and hands raised towards the sky. They were singing a song that their fathers had taught them, and their fathers’ fathers before that. The elders were humming and dancing, twisting their bodies like hundred years old trees bending their branches - up and down, from the ground to the clouds, like they were going to shake the sky the way the wind was shaking them. These men, at least 50 years of age, were offering their voices and bodies to their gods - they were the true devotees to their faith, their people and their gods. And right now it was one specific god they were trying to please - the God of the flowing Water Uku. The tribe needed him to show benevolence towards them so they could rebuild their village again. Every time it was destroyed, the elders made their dance and sung this song as an offering to the Greatest. And still, none of the Gods responded. But believing in something was way better than feeling forgotten, cursed and left behind so they chose to keep on believing in what the old generations had taught them. 
 
The wooden idol doll in the center was put very still on the ground and didn’t fall back from its place - as if it had grown roots into the very core of the Earth. Sequoyah had to admit that it looked rather eerie - its carved face had only two enormously big, wide-opened eyes and nothing else. No mouth, no eyebrows, no nose - this expressionless ancient doll was giving the warrior literal chills.  

He moved his stare onto his uncle, who has right behind the dancing circle, and their eyes met for a second - it was as if Mohe was reading him like an open book. Like he knew what happened into that forest just a few minutes ago. It was driving Sequoyah crazy. To be read so easily. So he moved his glance off his uncle to his feet and took some more wood from the ground, moving it to the big pile to his left. 

&#150; Sequoyah! - somebody’s anxious voice called for him. 

He turned around to see who was calling him, pretending he didn’t already recognize that sweet, enchanting voice. 

&#150; Atsila. - he greeted politely. - What brings you here? 

He saw her face and suddenly an image of her as a child appeared before him - her ebony hair, slightly brownish and small as seeds eyes, her full, naturally glossy lips - all that made her look like a goddess from the legends they all had heard. But that was long ago - the older she got, the more different her structure became. Her chin sharpened, her eyes darkened and she rarely gave a smile to anyone... and yet her voice had never changed in the slightest - sweet, melodic and serene, like honey dripping from the beehive. Maybe the thing that made the contrast between her looks and her voice was the fresh white paint covering her face, except for the eyelids and lips, which made her seem even paler than she already was. Now her beauty had changed, she was still lovely but in a more mature way that made her unappealing to most boys in the tribe. Everybody admired her but still no one dared lay a hand on her.

&#150; I saw something... again... - Atsila whispered lowly and mysteriously, her eyebrows forming a tight line.
 
You see, she had a gift. She was something like a priestess except only Sequoyah and she knew about that. In their tribe, women who had the gift of seeing the future were damned to remain a possession of the Circle of the Elders. No life, no family, no kids... a life between seven old men waiting for her to spill prophecy after prophecy, expecting her to foretell where the storm will hit - when this was impossible for anyone. They both did everything in their power to avoid her dreams becoming public knowledge but if she called him like that, in front of all those people, what she saw must have been truly scary.

Atsila grabbed Sequoyah by the hand and pulled him slightly away from the rest.

&#150; I had a vision. I saw a light, maybe a spirit. And it was calling me... 

*Calling her?* - the boy thought to himself - *Like it called me today...* 

&#150; Calling me to go after it. But when I followed it, it got killed. On the spot, everything started to crumble down - the world was shaking around me, the storm was coming over me stronger than before and I woke up with the tingy taste of death on my tongue...

They both fell silent for a moment. Sequoyah was the first to speak, but very hesitantly: 

&#150; This dream... how long have you been seeing it? 

&#150; Two or three times already - Atsila said even quieter. - but every time it’s different. This time I saw you there, too. 

&#150; Me?! 

&#150; Yes, you were standing behind the spirit, crying over its fading corpse. 

&#150; Why would I be crying? - a hint of fear started echoing in his voice. 

&#150; You tried to protect it when the spear went through its body... 

A dreadful silence fell between them again. The air had suddenly become dense and they were both finding it hard to breathe. 

&#150; Sequoyah, I think I just made a terrible prophecy, I am so scared...  

&#150; Atsila, listen to me. - he took her hand in his. - You saw nothing. That dream... forget about it. It means nothing if we don’t try to make sense of it. Understood? 

&#150; But what I saw isn’t nothing, you know I can see things... 

&#150; I know, I know. I trust you with what you told me. But if what you saw is true, we are already doomed! 

&#150; Did you... did you see it happen? 

*How do I tell her that Onakona actually killed that spirit... maybe he even triggered her prophecy...* - his thoughts were racing faster than ever, making his head hurt a little bit. - *No, I cannot tell her this, she’ll go mad...*

&#150; Sacrifice! - the feverish scream of one of the elders made them both go out of their trance. - Sacrifice! The gods need a sacrifice or we will be forever cursed! 
 
*Oh, mother earth, we already are...* - Sequoyah thought to himself and squeezed Atsila’s hand even tighter.

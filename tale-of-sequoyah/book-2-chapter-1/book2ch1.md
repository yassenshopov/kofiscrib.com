# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 1: The Departure

A heavy silence suddenly fell upon the crowd of young men and women when elder Atohi came to see his granddaughter off. The trees were strangely quiet, like they have never roared before. The water had drained out of the village and the ground was once again dry and not muddy. It was so relieving to watch the horses stand still and firm on solid ground that it was almost feeling like a gravely miracle. The sky was unbelievably clear, without even a trace of clouds and Sequoyah could swear to whatever gods his tribe was worshiping, that this was a calm before the storm. The air was so tense that Sequoyah feared it might explode around them. It was truly unnerving to watch how the “fated to die”, as they had called her earlier, was saying one last “goodbye” to her home. 

*“Fated to die? I don’t believe in fate...”* the boy said to himself bitterly. *“And still these are her last moments with the people she loves.”*

The three men making up the “convoy of the doomed” had already packed their luggage for the long trip, saddled and strapped the horses hard as they had been taught. Their faces could not be read - they showed no emotion at all besides the mysterious, luring feeling of going into the wild. Onakona, the Spirit Killer, was once again armed with spears and arrows, his mouth forming a tight line. His expression was rather severe, his teeth clenched and his fists holding firm onto the reins. The others were just trying to imitate his strong, unreadable presence, looking like no more than vague shadows behind his back. 

Atsila had finally managed to pull herself together. Her eyes were red from crying, making the white on her cheeks and forehead look  even whiter. She was looking like warrior with her brand new attire - the usual brown leather girdle that was falling down straight to her knees and rather flabby top with warm a hood of fox’s fur was changed by a new, horsemen style. She had a pair of leather pants, some new tar coloured boots on her feet, a warm, big and long coat of wolf fur with a big hood and under it a long linen shirt that looked rather old but very durable. And still, even equipped better than all of her “legion”, her thin womanly figure was looking the most vulnerable of all, the most fragile. 

The girl was stubbornly looking in one point in the distance without deigning to meet the glare of the people around her who wanted to offer her their empathy. Atsila looked fierce - the terrified girl from last night was long gone and her expression was now fierce, as if she would eat alive whoever dared approach her. 

&#150; Sequoyah. - Mohe’s voice suddenly pushed all other thoughts away from the boy’s head. - Did you prepare everything? 

&#150; Yes, uncle. - Sequoyah replied a little bit hurried. 

&#150; Food? Clothes? 

&#150; Yes. 

&#150; What about... knives? Swords? - a little bit hesitantly asked the elder, looking once again at Atsila that was standing a few feet away.

&#150; I-I sharpened... my knives last night... 

The words came out stiff and muted, the affliction choking him the moment when he thought about what he was ordered to do. He needn’t finish his sentence - Mohe already knew what the boy meant. In his eyes was reflected the same grief, the same pain and for once in his very ungrateful life, Sequoyah felt his heart fill with love for his uncle and his sympathy.  

*“How tragic! How very tragic...”* he thought to himself. *“I am seeing this man in a different light only now when I’m about to leave... and I may never return...”*

&#150; Take care, kid. - Mohe said rather awkwardly and walked away without further ado. 

Little did his nephew knew how much he would appreciate his uncle and the warmth of home when the forest had already embraced them all with its devilish hospitality.

Atohi came right before the planned hour for departure. He came quietly and blessed all four horses, then said a few kind words to the warriors of the “legion” before taking his granddaughter’s hand. He looked at her in the blood-red eyes, pressed his lips gently onto her forehead and started whispering something to her. Some soothing words probably. She didn’t break down as Sequoyah expected to happen - actually she looked stone hard listening to his goodbyes. Atsila didn’t utter even a sound - it was like her lips were sewed. The girl didn’t even look Atohi in the eyes - she just gave him her baldric and slightly raised her hands. He sighed, told her a few more things and without any more procrastination strapped tight the baldric onto her waist and one of her thighs. 

The fated to die was finally ready to greet death. 

&#150; On the horses! - elder Kanuna raised his voice and within seconds all four were already on a horseback. 

&#150; May the gods protect and help you. - elder Yona blessed them and the horsemen knew that the time had come. 

They quickly spurred the horses and leaped fast towards the horizon, not a single one of them looking back to say goodbye. Later in the woods, they regretted bitterly that they had not done it.

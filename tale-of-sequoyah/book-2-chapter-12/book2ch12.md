# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 12: The Revelation

And for a second there was nothingness. Nothing filling the void, just her floating around it. Some strange noises were coming from around her, but her ears could not exactly catch what was going on. She was so peaceful, clueless, her mind totally absent, and she loved that feeling so much, not wanting to get out of it ever again…

&#150; Return to us, Priestess, return to the realm of your worshipers… - someone was humming next to her, its voice terrible and almost painful to listen to, but brutal enough to take her out of her trance.

Atsila had not realized it, but she was chocking, gasping for air so desperately that the moment she heard Waya’s voice and came to her sense, she quickly and abruptly stood from where she was laying and kneeled, coughing and holding her throat with both hands as the peaceful nothingness started slipping off and fear, realisation as well as the sheer terror of this revelation started flooding her body and her soul. 

&#150; Atsila, answer me! – a hand gripped her arm harshly but was quickly pushed away of her.

She was trembling like a leaf on the wind, the vision still fresh in her mind. He was going to kill her after all. He was going to slither her throat without thinking twice. He despised her for making him a monster, he was never going to forgive her, not as long as he was breathing. 

&#150; She needs to give some answers, we can’t keep on stopping along the way just because she fell into a trance! – Onakona’s familiar voice echoed inside the Priestess’ head and for a brief second his face swapped with Sequoyah’s in this dreadful vision, grinning against her instead of crying after her blood started draining off.

Atsila was paralysed, unable to move or to speak, unable to even think. She had just witnessed and tasted her own death, her own goddamn death was playing again and again before her eyes, making her urge to vomit even bigger, stronger.

&#150; Leave the Priestess memorize her vision, child. – Waya’s disgusting, low voice sounded the highest among the choir of quarrelling men.

&#150; I won’t let her do anything except keep moving because we do not have time! – Onakona yelled again, but for some reason he didn’t say anything more. 

&#150; Onakona, the sun is already starting to set, we should probably just make a bivouac here. – Toke suggestion was accepted with an angry growl but still approved by the leader of the group.

People started moving here and there – Toke bringing some woods, Onakona spreading his furs, Sequoyah tying Waya’s foot to a nearby tree while glancing over her from time to time. The only one left by her side was Kinunote, in whose arms she had fallen when the trance took over her mind. He was the one holding her while she was gone from this world, the one shaking her awake, the one who was now holding her head, rubbing her shoulder softly while her shock-stricken body was laying on the ground. Atsila didn’t dare move, or maybe she wouldn’t be able to if she tried. The images of the twisted face, angry and bitter was always before her eyes. Maybe that was why he didn’t come to comfort her – he simply didn’t want to. He simply confirmed her deepest fear – his resentment.

&#150; Leave her alone for now, she will recover from this. – the which hummed almost amused, probably wanting to get Kinunote’s attention. – It was only about time she started receiving such visions. The shock will fade.

For a few moments the guy was gone, and the girl was laying on her back, alone, in the dirt. The fire was lit, furs all gathered around, including hers. Somebody probably took her bag off her back when she passed out and took the fur out now. The grass was tickling Atsila’s skin, making the life in her limbs slowly return, but the dreadful feeling inside her gut was wrecking. Not that she didn’t expect this turn of events, but she surely didn’t expect her beloved, her closest friend to betray her. To despise her, to use her name as a curse, as a bad omen. 

Bad omen. Maybe that’s what I am, she said to herself and tried raising herself from the ground. 

Her whole body was heavy, her bones weary and tired so the only thing she was able to do was lift her head slightly, then let it fall back in the grass. The shock was beginning to wear off, but her exhaustion was still present, overpowering her while the sorrow started creeping steadily inside her heart. Atsila was surely a pathetic view right now, laying down and moving slightly only to breathe, one of her hands still on her throat. She couldn’t quite get rid of the sensation of it being slithered, of the blood draining out of her, while her lungs were fighting for some air…

&#150; Want me to take you to the fire? – a quiet voice interrupted the Priestess’ thoughts, making the clouds upon her even darker.

&#150; Sequoyah… - the girl whispered, feeling the tears coming back to her eyes. – Sequoyah, please…

Before she could even finish her sentence, the hunter tucked his hands under her arms lifting her gently up so the girl could at least sit up. And then, without any hesitation, he took her into a rushed, but comfortable embrace. After all, he was coming to be her solid stone, her guardian. As much as Atsila enjoyed his sudden display of affection, his comfort and his support, she couldn’t get rid of the feeling that she wasn’t worthy of anything like it. She wasn’t worthy of his kindness, of his support, only of his destructive anger and resentment. This was some time borrowed from another life – her time with him when like this, a time that will sooner than later be taken away from her and it was devastating. 

&#150; You are crying. – Sequoyah plainly stated while tightening his grip around her shoulders.

I am?, the girl thought to herself and almost immediately felt the tears rolling t=down her face, soaking Sequoyah’s leather jacket. 

&#150; I need to get away from here. – her voice was low, trembling, somehow broken, while the vision was repeating and repeating before her closed eyelids. – I can’t do this to you. Or myself. I’m sorry… for I must leave you…

Absolute silence fell upon them, except Atsila’s sobs filling the tense air between them. And as she started crying harder and harder and their body merged closer and closer, he finally spoke softly inside her hair:

&#150; I know.

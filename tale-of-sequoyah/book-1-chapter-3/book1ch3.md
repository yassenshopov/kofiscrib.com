# BOOK 1: The Beginning
## Chapter 3: The Sacrifice

The night after the ritual was hotter than ever - it was literally hard for anyone to breathe as the heat was sticking to the skin as if a toxic lizard was slowly poisoning them. The smell of sweat and fear filled the dense night air, making it feel even more overwrought. The Circle of the Elders was gathered once more that day but this time to decide who was going to be the victim of the gods. While dancing in the ritual earlier that day, Yona, one of the members of the Circle, received a message from Uku. As he described it, his spirit spoke through him and he wasn’t conscious of what he had screamed out until he woke up from the trance on the ground with a sore throat and was later retold the story. This was unprecedented - never had the elders seen such a thing. Their gods were neutral to their sufferings mkst of the time and it was rather odd that they wanted a sacrifice only now and not years ago when they got trapped in this apocalyptic land. But whoever of the elders thought about it that deeply, didn’t have the courage to make his point out loud so they all remained silent. 

&#150; It’s finally time to decide what to do. - Enoli spoke first breaking the heavy silence. - We have to decide who is going to be offered to Uku or else we are losing precious time. 

&#150; Elder Enoli probably knows that we are gathered here for the same reason, doesn’t he? - said politely but sorely elder Kanuna. 

&#150; Then I suppose elder Kanuna has a suggestion? 

&#150; I’m afraid I do not. Elder Mohe, what do you think of the matter? 

&#150; I refuse to be a part of this. - Mohe replied briefly with his eyebrows locked in a dreadful line. 
 
&#150; Then you refuse to save our tribe! - another one got irritated by his answer.  

&#150; The quarrels are not going to help us choose the sacrifice, right? - elder Adohi interrupted them. 

He was the eldest among them and supposedly - the wisest. Everybody had trust in him and in his grey hair and wrinkled forehead. The children found him a little bit scary with his blurry eyes and eyeballs that looked like they were dug unnaturally deep into his skull.

&#150; Forget all your acquisitive motives. - he began slowly. - Let go of all hate and preferences. The ego has no place in this conversation. Think. Who would be the most suitable offering for a god? Someone strong or clever, or young, or virgin? 

&#150; I say the strongest fighter in our village! - Kanuna exclaimed. 

&#150; No, the wisest! - Enoli argued.

&#150; Have you gone mad, haven’t you read that the virgin life is most suitable for the Greatest? - another added. 

&#150; But young people are more full of energy and vitality! - someone else interrupted. 

&#150; The right answer here is unknown but the closest to it I think I know - we shall sacrifice one of our closest ones, our children. - calmly said Adohi and all voices slowly faded like an echo in a cave. - This would be a sacrifice most precious. 

For a few moments the elders fell silent like they had all of a sudden lost their voices. They were most probably trying to process what Atohi had just said and, most certainly, trying to come up with an argument that proves his suggestion as impractical. And still, nobody wanted to question his authority. It was like walking on thin ice and it seemed like nobody wanted to run the risk...

&#150; I find it more convenient for my beliefs to remain neutral in this debate. - abruptly said Mohe, his voice harsh and low. - If I were to decide, I wouldn’t let any person become offering for Uku - let alone my nephew. 

&#150; Heretic! - almost all of them yelled at him in one voice. - Heretic! Do you not worship the gods?! 

&#150; You sound like you have accepted Adohi’s decision? - fired Mohe back at them through clenched teeth. - Then which one of you is going to put his child’s head on the log? 

&#150; Enough, Mohe. - the eldest member tried to bring peace. - We heard and accepted your opinion. Now leave it to the rest to decide.

But they yet again fell silent. 

&#150; I see. - Adohi started. - No one is going to make a personal sacrifice. I understand you and still, I despise you. You are all cowards, don’t want to lose but want to gain the benevolence of the Greatest. 

&#150; But we... - tried to explain himself Kanuna. 

&#150; I don’t blame you, however, for your cowardice. - continued the elder without even noticing his complaint. - In times like these, one has to bear the burden of the expectations. 

&#150; We... 

&#150; Therefore, if nobody is ready to make this great sacrifice, I am. I am offering my beloved granddaughter Atsila to the God of the flowing Water Uku. Bring all the warriors outside - we’ll let her choose who will be executing the ritual. And now, excuse me - I should probably go and tell her the faith that the Circle had alloted her. 

With no more than a nod did Atohi exit the made-up tent, leaving everyone inside speechless, with hearts sunk to their toes.

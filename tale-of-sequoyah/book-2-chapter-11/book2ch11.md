# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 11: The Pain

*Coward! Go away from here. Go away. He does not wish to see you. He despises you.*

The voice was so vivid, so true inside her head, that Atsila almost jumped off her spot when it started echoing inside her mind, reverberating throughout her whole body, vibrating and moving freely around. The voice was so light yet so clear, ringing threateningly inside her brain, that it was impossible to say if it was even human. Was it the spirit again? The feeling when its eerie voice was talking inside her head was completely different, devastating even, licking her whole body with its burning harsh tongue, but still – what was she hearing if not the spirits talking around her? What was so cunning to get inside her head so easily again?
 
*He won’t hesitate to kill you, to slaughter you how your grandfather desired. He will accomplish what he came for.* 

It was going on and on and even while walking with the rest of the group, Atsila was feeling her feet taking her elsewhere.  She was completely disoriented, lost inside this voice – so hypnotical and brutal, that even her eyes started playing her tricks. The world around quickly became gray, all sounds coming from it drowned its vacuum. Her head was starting to hurt a little bit and her heart to beat so fast that for a brief moment she thought that everyone around her was hearing its deafening, horrendous noises, the banging endless inside her chest. The Forest around the girl was starting to look even eerier and her heart quickly sank to her feet that moment her eyes met Sequoyah’s. But Atsila simply couldn’t stop – she was looking at him, staring like a madwoman, unable to regain control of her own body. And still, she was moving yet her mind was stuck in exactly one place.

*Hell. That is where you belong.*

Sequoyah was looking at her, the expression in his eyes shifting slightly – from tense to desperate, to furious, to something that was oddly reminding Atsila of pure sympathy, or pity. His stare was intense, and she was already feeling his feverish eyes move across her whole body, inspecting her, marking her, even. The boy’s face was pale, looking unexplainably surprised by something, but his fists clenched at his sides were saying otherwise. 

*He will forever despise you for your decision. Do you want to make him suffer like that? Do you want to make him live with his own guilt and misery all his life just because you took one selfish decision?*

Maybe he was indeed still angry, maybe his wrath was still lingering beneath his skin, reminding him of his outburst from earlier that day. Did the young hunter think about her then? Did he become angry just because he reminded himself of what lies ahead of them? Did he spat these angry words in her face just because he was thinking about that rainy day when she chose him to be her executor? 
 
*You will bring him only pain and misery. You will make him a murderer. He will loathe himself for eternity, giving away his soul when yours leaves this world and you claim to love him! Or maybe that is what you want – together forever? Your loved one – your murderer.*

- Oh gods… - the girl whispered to herself, taking her eyes off her beloved, her body shaking and temples burning with heat.

Before she could even realize it, the first drop fell down her cheek followed by a whole river – mighty and unstoppable, burning hot as if she wasn’t crying but spilling the blood out of her own self, disgusted and afraid of the truth she had just heard ringing between her ears. The girl was feeling so dizzy that for a second, her world was spinning around, moving so terrifyingly fast that it suddenly became just a blurry spot, colorful but deceiving. Moments ago, beneath her feet, there was soil, solid ground, some wild grass, and poisonous berries, and now she was barely noticing its presence. It felt like she was so light, so goddamn detached from this reality that her thoughts were taking her higher and higher in the sky, making her stomach turn with fear and despair. Atsila was unaware of everything around her, her senses starting to shut one by one. 

*What is happening with me?* she thought to herself, trying to collect her composure, to gather all that was left of her consciousness after what that cruel voice had said. 

*Maybe it is right, after all, maybe I am too selfish to see how I’m torturing him. Maybe I really want to take him with me where I’m going. Maybe I am too afraid to go beyond, maybe…*
 
A hard blow made the river of her thoughts cease its flow and before she could even start thinking about what was going on, someone grabbed her hands and shook her hard, making her world even more blurred and surreal. Atsila heard somebody scream, heard him shout like crazy, making her feel even more nauseous. Another shake of her almost lifeless body and probably a slap later, she was absolutely relying on whoever was holding her, giving in to the pressure falling on top of her. 

The girl was slipping into another prophecy - her weakness had made her an easy threat, easy to slip into the reality of what lies in front of them all. Her whole body was numb, the blood continuing to fall down her face and the only thing she could tell for sure was that the screaming around her had gotten quieter. Or maybe she had slipped too deep, maybe she was at a point of no return from the realm of dreams…

*The boy was over her, holding a knife next to her throat, the metal still not touching her skin. His eyes were fierce, his skin – burning and his hands trembling a little. He was a predator, and she was the prey, exactly as it was allotted to be.*

*- Sequoyah, please… - she stared at him, no tears, no emotion, just a blank but terrified face. – Tell me you love me. Please.*

*And exactly when the last word fell out of her mouth, the cold weapon was pressed against her skin, burning and cooling it at the same time. Its sharp edge was starting to dig into her flesh, making the girl wince with pain. Sequoyah looked unyielding, absolutely cold and distant, preparing himself for the deadly cut.* 
 
*- No, not before you tell me you love me. – Atsila almost cried, trying to soothe herself, telling her inner voice that she is going to a better place, or maybe a worse one, but still, she was going somewhere.*

*She would not get lost; her soul would find its place.* 

*- I despise you. – the hunter spat hatefully, making her heart tremble and her eyes instantly closed. – I will loathe you for eternity.*

*The moment has come.* 

*The next thing Atsila felt was unbearable pain, coming in waves stronger and stronger, pure agony overtaking her whole being and the fire starting to burn inside of her had raged within seconds. Her lungs were dying, her brain was barely functioning and all she could do at this point is breathe. But when she tried inhaling, her whole being screamed and cried, and screamed and cried and the last thing she saw before her eyes started blurring was Sequoyah’s tear-stained cheeks, one of his hands on his mouth, trying to make his sobs quieter, and the other still holding the bloody knife…*

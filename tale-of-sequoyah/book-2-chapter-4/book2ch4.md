# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 4: The Hatred

“Once the night shifts to day and the soothing moon to burning sun, once the roots go upwards reaching for the sky and the blood from its natural veins mixes with the human sin flowing in the soil itself, hell shall be brought down to earth, a mere wave of the anger of the gods, humbling man's pride, crushing his bones and encouraging his faith…”

Atsila was humming go herself the first few verses of the elder's chant. They made every single one of the tribe listen to it, memorize it, and, eventually, believe in it. She had always found it amusing even though a bit far-fetched. “The human sin flowing in the soil itself” was a funny sentence, to begin with, but now, stuck in this terrible place full of threats and hostility, she started to understand the concept of punishment and hell. Before the thick forest unraveled to her all kinds of evil wonders and deadly spirits, the girl somehow always pictured the place like a huge storm - a storm full of souls and crying, terrified shadows that rummaged around the earth until not a single thing was left behind to tell the story of the Apocalypse. She pictured herself in it, the force it could have, the power it could possess, the unholy but divine ability to annihilate everything and everyone. But this giant vortex full of all joy and bliss existing in this already cursed world was rather metaphorical to Atsila, living and growing inside of every single one of them until they eventually turn mad and get lost in the depths of the earth. 
 
Now, after everything she had seen and would probably see again, she pictured the wrath of the gods exactly like a forest. The Forest. That was where all the unholy creatures and sinful souls were locked and forced to haunt the unfortunate enough to step a foot inside. The closer the hunters were getting to the core, to the mountain, the deadlier and trickier the obstacles were becoming. The darker the path. The darker the thoughts. Was that not hell, indeed. The constant dread, the dark sky, the blood-hot rain mixed with tears and sweat, the everlasting feeling that today might be the last day of your life.

Hell now seemed a lot more physical to the young lady than it had ever done. Even in her dreams. Even in her prophecies…

&#150; Atsila. - a sharp voice made her snap out of her thoughts.-Careful with the knife.

Toke looked at her very cautiously while she was holding her dagger. Without noticing she had taken it out of its sheet and unconsciously twisting it in her hand.

&#150; Do not worry. - the girl replied. - I won't kill myself… for now.

Sequoyah chuckled a little bit but then immediately took off the amused face and replaced it with a stone-cold mask. For a moment he had forgotten about his true purpose on this mission. The second he came to his senses, the second he felt the sharp metal weight in his hand like crazy and the guilt and embarrassment bursting inside him, he growled irritatedly and took a few bigger steps ahead, trying to avoid any possible contact with Atsila. After last night and her vision, he was restless. All eyes and ears. Ready and waiting for the beast. Whatever it was - a form-shifting spirit, an animal, a god, he would handle it as much as he could. The promise he gave his best friend was not going to be broken, not as long as he was breathing.
 
&#150; How do you plan on killing her? - a sudden question popped out of Onakona's mouth, luckily far away from Atsila's ears that had already vanished into the world of her visions.

It caught him by surprise, so twisted and evil and at the same time so crucial. As much as Sequoyah didn't want to think about it, he had to find a way to make it fast. And painless.

&#150; I haven't thought about that. - he replied brief and harsh.

&#150; But you should. - the other man replied in a cold but amused manner. - The bloodier, the better. The happier the gods will be.

&#150; And since when are you an elder to know what the gods like? 

The anger inside Sequoyah was rising quickly, vicious and unwanted, unsearched for but still painted all black by his hatred for Onakona himself.

&#150; Respect traditions, boy. Or you will be the next offering after her.

An outright threat. He must have sensed the boy's reluctance to kill the granddaughter of elder Adohi.

&#150; I'll gladly lay beside her on the stone. - Sequoyah suddenly stopped, bringing everyone to a stop and utter confusion. - But I would much rather sacrifice you and use your arrogant, dirty, and vicious skin for a floor mat in my home.

&#150; You really are very sure of your abilities, aren't you? - Onakona snapped at him almost smiling.

&#150; You have no idea…

Sequoyah gritted his teeth and tightened the grip around the knife, laying strapped on his right hip. The air was tense and the sparks between them two were almost going to cause a fire so big and bright that even the sun would get jealous of its heat.

&#150; Enough of that! - Kinunote, whose voice no one had heard for quite some time, echoed in the air but they didn't even bother listening to him.
 
&#150; We should keep moving. - Toke tried a more careful approach but his plead got lost somewhere in the deafening silence between the two men in the front of the group.

Mockingly and slowly, Onakona took his blade off its leather case and tried spotting his reflection on it.

&#150; Stop that non… - Atsila began surely of herself, but quickly got interrupted.

&#150; You won't ever be able to get to me. Not while you have this embarrassing attachment with guilt and fear. You can't even hunt properly, you are always showing mercy towards the pray. - he spitted. - And besides, I don't even get why you are getting so mad. One less whore in the village - what's the problem?

With a deafening roar, Sequoyah's body was already on top of Onakona's. A distant scream in the background echoed in their ears, probably Atsila's, but this didn't bother her friend even one bit. His anger was blinding, his fists - unstoppable, his bloodthirst - insatiable.

&#150; Don’t… ever think… of calling her… a whore! - Sequoyah barked at his opponent while pushing his head in the dirt. - You little, useless, disgusting creature! 

A sudden wave of pain overtook the boy and numbed all his other senses. He felt the blood rush down his elbow to the wrist and the pulsating wound on his upper arm. A distraction for a second and he somehow fell under the weight of Onakona, blood dripping from his dagger. He was spitting his words like venom down at him while pressing the blade onto his throat.
 
&#150; I can skin you alive and make you watch how I slither her throat slowly and painfully, how I drink her blood while offering her body to the gods, and the only thing you will be able to do is to scream, and watch, and cry…

&#150; HELP!

The unearthly screech made them both lose interest in each other for a moment and look around. Everyone was taken aback, trying to locate where it came from. Onakona finally acknowledged Atsila's presence on his back, grabbing onto his arms, preventing him from doing further harm to Sequoyah. But it wasn't her. It wasn't her streaming. Even she hadn't foreseen this happening.

The four of them looked at each other's pale faces. That was a human scream and still, it sounded so… odd. So strange and unearthly, like it was made in inhuman agony and wrath. Nowhere around could be seen neither spirits nor creatures…

When suddenly a pack of wolves appeared behind the trees, vicious and angry, пяна falling down their canine mouths. They were following something, preying on some unfortunate creature that was running in the high grass. Beneath their growls, one could easily sense their irritation, their bloodthirst, the agony of not being able to catch whatever was running away from them.

&#150; Don't. Move. - Kinunote mouthed to the rest of the hunters.

Nobody actually could, so stupefied with fear and surprise. They only lowered their bodies on the ground, suddenly forgetting every grudge they had held towards each other a second ago. Holding onto each other’s arms, legs, clothes, listening carefully for something approaching them, they fell absolutely quiet under the shadow of the mighty pine tree.

For a moment, everything seemed calm. It seemed like the pack had moved away. Like it was gone now. The wind was blowing around, revealing no trace of the enormous wild wolves. But still, something seemed rather off to Sequoyah.

&#150; I almost thought we would get eaten… - Toke sighed rather unconsciously than on purpose and immediately was given a sharp, stinging hit in the ribs to shut his goddamn mouth.

&#150; Maybe we need to move. - Onakona suggested.

&#150; No. The pack should move. Not us. - Kinunote said very knowledgeably and no one had the actual desire to say otherwise. 

Nobody dared move an inch even though the place looked deserted already. But one thing was bugging Sequoyah's mind - what made that I human scream? What creature could be able to produce such a sound, so gut-churning and terrifying?

&#150; I don't hear them. - Atsila whispered.

&#150; Neither do I. - Onakona replied briefly, obviously very irritated by the fact they were sharing an opinion.

&#150; Maybe we should look around carefully and…

Another agonizing scream made the hunters' hairs stand on their backs. It wasn't until a rather small, humanoid body came running from the high grass towards them then Sequoyah finally understood the words:

“Help!”

The wolves were running after it with such a graceful but frightening speed that Onakona could only admire it and Sequoyah only dread it. 

&#150; Get back! - he yelled to the others that were already getting up and trying to climb on the pine.

The stinging wound on his forearm didn't bother the hunter at all as he stood at the bottom of the tree while Onakona, Kinunote, and Toke started climbing upwards. His grip on the blade was unbreakable and the look on his face - freezing cold, but deep inside he was shaking like crazy.

&#150; It is coming closer! - Atsila almost cried while struggling to climb even the lowest branches.

“Help, help, help!”, the guardian of the tree kept hearing this line again and again, and again, while the little figure was coming closer and closer towards them. He could not see much from it but as it seemed, it had two legs on which it ran for dear life. He soon started noticing hair, flying freely around it, arms and fingers, mouth. And finally with the last desperate call for help Sequoyah finally met its eyes - two burning beads, reflecting the fear and agony it was feeling.

That wasn't a creature.

That was a human. A woman.

&#150; Sequoyah, get up here! - the boy heard a yell towards himself but the shock had overtaken him and he couldn't move at all.

*A human? Here? Someone had survived the life in the woods all by himself?! I can't believe it*, he thought to himself while griping the blade even harder, until his knuckles became all white and his hands almost went numb.

&#150; Sequoyah! - another call from Atsila being absolutely ignored.

The wild wolves were getting closer and closer to the woman, almost breathing into her back, saliva and blood dripping from their mouths. He had to help her. She had survived so much, all alone in the forest, he had to fight off the pack. Everyone was age on the tree - this moment was his last opportunity.

The boy quickly threw the blade to his side, tucked in his dagger, and took out of his leather pocket two little stones. The adrenaline was bursting inside his body and before he could even realize what was going on, he had already taken a stray stick from the ground and ripping a piece of cloth off his sleeve, tying it tight around the wood. A few distant screams were filling the background of his fast hands but he didn't bother to acknowledge them - he had to save this woman, he felt it deep inside him. A few hits in one another and the stones made light and hot spark so quickly that by the time one blink was made, the cloth was already burning bright and he was already running towards the woman.

&#150; Sequoyah! 

The hunter ran and ran towards the danger, went inside the high grass seeing not too much but enough in order to locate the pack and the prey. But as he was trying to reach for her, the human figure stumbled and fell in the dirt, unable to get up. Her head was between her hands, crying, shivering, and desperate.

*Oh, dang it*, Sequoyah thought to himself but didn't hesitate even for a second to stop. His feet were faster than lightning itself, driven by his very anger and ambition.

With a single leap, he hopped over her and literally nailed his feet in the ground, holding the burning stick on top of his head, waving it mercilessly to the creatures. Suddenly bringing their run into a stop, they growled loudly and angrily in the sight of fire. Their teeth were gritted at him, their nails ready to take him down with a single swing. 

For a moment everything was silent around Sequoyah like time had stopped spinning and marching forward towards his death between these creatures' canines. They seemed utterly annoyed by his little trick but didn't dare approach him too close. Instead, the pack encircled them both and he had no choice but to wave the stick in circles just to cover all sides. The other hand was laying restlessly on his belt where the dagger was placed, sending the high possibility of the wolves attacking even with the fire on top of his head. The boy felt their steps, every single little step with which the circle was getting smaller and smaller, and smaller…

&#150; Back! Away! - a voice rose to the top of the trees, shaking every single one around whole, making them feel the vibrations of power, emitted by this command. 

Everything shook around, everything fell even quieter. The wolves' ears went up - they became cautious, on their guard, the nails in their paws slowly went back inside and the growling suddenly stopped.

And just like that, they disappeared in the dark of the eternal oaks around them.

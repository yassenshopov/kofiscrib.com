# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 10: The Chant

> *Tree after tree after tree*

> *all the forest shall fall to its knees* 

> *and when its powerful master arrives*

> *hell shall fall upon all of mankind*

As she was sitting by the fire, Atsila was humming part of another hymn that the elders had memorized from their ancestors and made all the children learn by heart when they were very little. The melody alone was sending shivers down Sequoyah’s spine, making him hate even more the memory of all the rituals the elders performed. They were bloody and disgusting, making him nauseous every time he looked at the offering on the small stone. Sometimes it was a child, sometimes an animal, and sometimes an adult. It depended on the occasion and the purpose of the ritual. Atsila’s choosing to be slaughtered was not a precedent – the Konjak tribe has always had that tradition, but it was never within the Elders’ circle. And never so far away – always right next to the river that ran across their land. The river of Uku, god of the flowing water. The ritual was made always by dusk when the blood was most eerie-looking, sparkling creepily on the setting sun, mixing with the clear waters of the river and making them a dirty shade of red and black, and tears, and soil…

> *Day after day after midnight*

> *men shall be led away from the light*

> *and if they don’t call upon their gods*

> *they shall never see the dawn*

How brutal, how terribly brutal their tribe was. To kill, to slaughter its own people just to please some abstract god in an abstract place that wasn’t helping them handle the storms or the waves, or the disasters. Offerings to some ancient, buried long ago and forgotten in an unknown grave ancestors that had been transformed from an old warrior story to a myth of a god. That’s what it was all about, what their so-called gods were about – old men, members of the tribe who had been worshiped for so long for their bravery that the lines between reality and pure mythology had been irreversibly blurred and smudged. Uku, the god that they were offering Atsila to, was an old man from their tribe who went sailing against the big waves with a spear in his hand, trying to stop the disaster, only to drown himself immediately, the water breaking his boat in a thousand pieces. The funny part comes when the waves started backing down after swallowing the poor man and all the Elders decided that Uku was some unnatural creature, a god reincarnated that could protect their people from future storms. 

> *Night after night after sunrise*

> *the trees shall begin to awaken.* 

> *But the danger lingering in the night*

> *will be preying on them forever. . .*

Ironical, truly ironical, they were worshiping men, long-buried and forgotten, most probably already rotten in the soil beneath their feet. So man's lives were wasted, so many false hopes for salvation bespoken, so much grief and anger could have been avoided if the devotees had just accepted the inevitable – the unstoppable, merciless storm that was going to kill them all one day or another. No gods, no ancestors, no offerings were going to postpone that. 

&#150; Enough of this, Atsila. – Kinunote suddenly said, his annoyance clear in his tone. - Or I will go mad, damn you!
 
Sequoyah, thinking the exact same thing, sighed in relief that he would no longer be subjected to this torture. Not that the humming was the problem - Atsila was an excellent singer, but still, this chant was making the hairs on his back stand. He didn’t want to interrupt her himself, not after the scene that happened only a few hours ago, and when somebody else did, he greeted the silence like an old ally.

The girl’s expression was cold, unbothered by Kinunote’s words, her eyes piercing and unforgiving. She was so enigmatic – one minute she is breaking down, bloody tears falling down her cheeks, smudging the paint on her face, her screams louder than hell itself and next moment she is cold, distant, and cruel, her eyes dark and clouded by horrific thoughts. Her being is a pure mystery, her head – impossible to decode. And yet, she was so transparent when her gaze fell upon Sequoyah. Her face suddenly became less tense, less distant, something in her black eyes swirled with some unknown but probably pleasant emotion at the sight of him. But only seconds later, probably reminding herself of his outburst earlier that day, right as Sequoyah was beginning to think she had forgotten it, her brows moved into a deep frown, her ears slightly trembled and she pressed her lips in a tight line, making the white on her face look even more fierce.  

She had not forgotten. Nor forgiven.

But so had he. This tattoo on her hand, still weaving around her small fingers, was a symbol of the secret she was keeping from him, and it was killing him, burning him from the inside with rage and fury that he hadn’t known so well before. She of all people, the one that doomed him to be her killer was now keeping secrets from him, making a fool out of himself yet again for trying to protect her. The thought alone was making his blood boil and the boy had no intention of just dropping the matter. 

*She will judge you for who you are*, a thin, very subtle voice started ringing inside his mind. *She will look down on you. The one who fated you to be the monster, the executor.* 
 
This voice was somewhat foreign, but not so much to Sequoyah’s mind. It was like taken out of a dream, or more of a nightmare of his, reminding him of all his fears, all his insecurities that linger beneath his composure. 

*She will bring you only guilt. Only pain and misery.*

As by command, Atsila turned around to face the young hunter. She looked at him with feverish eyes, with a wildness that he had never, ever seen overtaking her. He kept her glare, sensing that something was wrong with her, but unable to move, unable to even speak, while this cunning little voice was whispering in his ear.

*Send her away. Send her into the woods. Or else you shall be bearing the guilt all your life. Bearing it for someone who will make you a murderer.*

*Murderer.*

She looked away, the flame in her eyes slowly fading but her slightly twitching ears were giving her away, signaling Sequoyah that something was off…

&#150; Sequoyah, tell me something. – someone’s voice made the young hunter halter in his steps, but he quickly recovered from the shock and looked up to meet Toke’s intense stare. – How far do you think we are from the mountain?

*But why is he asking me about this*, he thought to himself, well aware that the witch and Onakona were in charge of the route, not him. *And how is he moving so silently around? I didn’t hear him approach me.*

&#150; Well… by the look of it, I think… – and his eyes traveled up and ahead to the rising slopes of the old, almost ancient mountain, searching for it in the distance just to notice that it now looked… so close. 

Too close.

*That’s not possible. I swear, last night it looked so far ahead and now we are almost at its mouth…*

&#150; I thought so as well. – Toke’s voice was low and emotionless, filled with simply nothing, making Sequoyah shiver a little bit. – I think your witch is playing tricks on us.

&#150; She’s not… she’s not my witch! – the boy fired back, choking on his anger by the mention of this terrible woman, his voice rising almost too much on top of the forest noise but fortunately, nobody turned around to see what was going on.

&#150; Whoever she is. I think she has us fooled.

&#150; What do you mean exactly? I don’t…

&#150; I smell dark magic, Sequoyah. Watch her carefully.

The last words were said very carefully, very lightly as if they originated from the wind and came flying towards his and only his ears, suddenly making all his senses spy the environment. The animals moving in the background, the earth vibrating, the leaves on the trees swinging, the air brushing through his hair… Everything seemed in its true order. Nothing odd – for the wild Forest, of course. The wild Forest beyond the sacred river of their village where nothing is ordinary and everything is prying on you, making you a living target. But yet again, the Forest wasn’t the only prying organism. Onakona, Waya – they were both hunters, but in a different sense of the word. Waya was most certainly a snake, a venomous one, who flourished in the misery of others, sneaking inside their minds and taking out their insecurities. Mind-player, manipulator, zealot - that was she. But an actual witch? The boy doubted it very much.  

&#150; Sleep withy your eyes open. – was the last thing Toke murmured before quickly dissolving into thin air, moving absolutely unnoticed somewhere that the boy’s eyes could not follow him.

# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 2: The Beast

They were riding all day long - no breaks, no food, no rest. The wild forest around them felt like a cage, like a prison that was enclosing them into its dark and sticky musk. Atsila felt like choking during the whole ride but tried her best to hide it... soon enough she would be choking on her own blood...

From time to time Sequoyah was making their secret signal to ask her if she was okay. She simply nodded and yet again placed her eyes on the path. Not that she didn't want to talk to him but Onakona was spying on them, studying them silently. The girls was having a bad feeling about his prying eyes, his hungry look was making her gut turn upside down. He was indeed planning something inside his cruel mind but nobody could read him like he read others. 

The trees were so tall and thick that they hid the sun from her vision. She saw a little bit of light but it was for such a brief moment that she couldn't feel the warm rays on her face. And how desperately she wanted to stop for a while, take a breath, think, for gods' sake, to think. Everything she knew, everything she hoped for disappeared in a blink of an eye - her grandfather did good to the tribe but not to her. And her wish to get married, to have kids, to have a family - it was all history not, just a distant memory of a life now unreachable for her. The only thing left now was to let herself see the visions she never let her mind think about - what else could she be helpful with? Her gift, her life, her soul... all wasted...

&#150; Get down. - a harsh voice woke up from her trance. 

It was Onakona, who was now holding the breaks of her horse. 

&#150; Get down the horse. - he repeated and this time she obeyed his harsh order. 

When her feet touched the ground, she almost fell on her back. They were trembling and unsteady, like she had never walked before. Sequoyah took her by the waist and helped her sit down on a few dry leaves. 

&#150; Absolute. Fool. - he murmured angrily while squeezing lightly up and down her legs in an attempt to help her walk easily again. - Making us ride like madmen all day...

&#150; Kinunote - this spiteful voice barked again. - Light a fire. Toke, Sequoyah, come with me - we are going hunting. 

He is separating us, Atsila thought to herself trying so hard to fight the terror rising inside her. He is sending him away, thinking that we may be plotting something...

Sequoyah looked at her with the expression of a dark rain cloud on his face. He was checking on her, making sure he left her well and expecting he would find her a few hours later all the same. He only nodded unexcitedly and, gripping onto his large bow, got lost in the wood's dark and misty depths. 

Kinunote was a weak man. A boy, actually. Only eighteen years of age, he was four years younger than her and way more indecisive than he seemed. A son in a loving family, a good brother, and, since recently, a husband. But his temper was somewhat easy to manipulate, his mind was weak compared to Onakona's and sadly this trait in his character defined him more than all his virtues. The others in his close circle knew him very well and used his susceptibility in a way that could serve good to their goals. Onakona didn't ask him to kill or lie directly but explained his tasks to him rather far-fetched, using his most efficient weapon - his manipulative words. A half-lie, half-truth. That was what Kinunote's life was all about.

&#150; Are you thirsty? - he asked Atsila after skillfully lightning a fire enclosed in small rocks.

&#150; Yes. 

The words slipped out of her mouth sounding so odd as if she didn't say them herself. Indeed, she was thirsty and starving, realizing it only now when the need was speaking through her, with her own voice. Her hands gripped the bag made of some animal's skin and gulped fast the water inside it. 

&#150; Thank you. - she lowered her head in a gesture of gratitude and returned the waterskin to its owner. 

But before he could say anything, a strange sound came from the woods. Atsila immediately turned around, holding onto the knife on her thigh. Something between a bark and a growl was coming from the dark part of the wood and it made the hairs on her back stand. It was becoming stronger and stronger like it was coming closer and closer to them and before the girl could even notice it, she had made a few steps backward ready for an escape run.

&#150; Atsila. - she heard a distant voice but didn't bother acknowledging it.

She felt her whole body stupefied and her head dizzy with fear. She now heard not one but more "things" coming her way and could not move an inch. Her readiness to run away simply disappeared the moment she saw something light and fast coming towards her. 

&#150; Atsila! - the voice was becoming more and more insistent but she still couldn't take her eyes off the thing.

Before she could take a step backward and fly off on her horse, an enormously big body landed on top of her with a terrifying growl and made her fall on her back on the ground. She started screaming and searching for her knives but her fingers were so numb with fear that she couldn't grip them properly. The creature looked like a dog but with an unnaturally muscled body, elongated limbs that now caged the girl under its trunk, and a huge head. The face was ugly like the elders had told them about all creatures inside these woods - small, almost nonexistent eyes, two slots serving it as a nose, and a terrible foamy mouth from which two canine teeth were emerging. Both were long almost to the point of touching the ground. Not to mention the sickening odor that came from it.

&#150; Atsila!

&#150; You're now dead. - it barked against the girl and she somehow understood its animal sound. - You're now dead! 

&#150; Atsila! 

She woke up with the gut-churning feeling of dread and utter horror on her tongue. The moment her eyes fixed Sequoyah in her sight, she turned around and threw up. She was shaking whole, her temples hurting and her forehead burning.

&#150; Thank God, she is alive. - she heard Kinunote sighed in relief.
 
&#150; But what happened to her in the first place? - asked Onakona darkly and by his tone, Atsila decided the question was directed towards Sequoyah.

&#150; It's none of your business. 

*Always so reckless*, the girl thought to herself and tried to speak for herself but felt another wave of sickness coming towards her and she threw up again.

&#150; It pretty much is since it's my job to deliver her to the gods. - the man replied calmly yet annoyed.

&#150; No, I pretty much think it is mine. - Sequoyah gave him as good he got. - Your job is to protect me. She is only my concern.

The last thing Atsila remembered of that night was reaching for the boy's hand while trying to come to her sense.

&#150; A vision? - he asked her quietly when everyone else was asleep.

&#150; Yes. - she could barely reply - her throat hurt so much since she had screamed her guts out. - And we will be under attack soon.

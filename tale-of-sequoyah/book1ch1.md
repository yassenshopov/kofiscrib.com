# BOOK 1: The Beginning
## Chapter 1: The Storm

The storm was just the beginning... 

When the uncontrollable force of nature hit their land, the Konjack tribe had already dug itself deep down in the mud, waiting for the weather to calm down. Everything around them - the trees, the rocks, even the sturdy wooden houses that served as their homes - was already spinning in the air and getting tossed away. Their village was being torn down to the ground once again - they had to rebuild it every two or three weeks since the stormy weather was the burden they had to bear while living on this land. And since it was never the right time to leave, they were stuck in the hell’s shell for two years already. The elders were afraid that this would last forever - the storms, the earthquakes, the big waves coming from the borderless ocean all around them. Like they were paying for a huge sin before their tribal gods - a never-ending curse that cost so much and yet gave them nothing in return.

The storm was always just the beginning. It was always followed by heavy rain, thunderstorms, and, the best for the end - big waves crashing into the trees along the coast. After such a turbulent sequence of events, the tribe had no choice except to scavenge from the water the still-useful remains of their homes and rebuild the whole village anew...

And all that was before the spirits started playing their mischievous tricks.

&#150; Sequoyah! - somebody barked. - Get down!

But the boy with the glowing tattoos, covered with mud and lichens, was busy looking at something in the distance, while the rain was pouring over their heads, washing the dirt off them. His hand was reached out as if he was trying to touch something far away from him and his eyes sparkled with sheer joy despite the conditions.

&#150; Sequoyah! - the voice rang again and its tingy sound made the boy snap out of it and obey immediately.

He buried his head between his arms and calmly, as much as he could, waited for the apocalypse to end. The joy from discovering the unknown thing he was trying reach faded quickly as the thunders suddenly cut through the night sky. Unconsciously, he shivered a little bit and hoped nobody saw him. And that’s when the waves started coming, washing his feet a little bit.

Within an hour, the whole village of the Konjack tribe was destroyed, simply gone. And as the moon began its slow descent from the sky, its light faded, making it even harder for the poor people to find the shreds of their shattered homes.

&#150; Never underestimate what nature can do. - an old man said to Sequoyah with grave seriousness. - Never, and I mean, absolutely never, should you peek your head to see the storm - you may not have it back on your neck next time...

You see, this strict old man, one of the elders and maybe the most skillful hunter in the whole tribe, somehow happens to be the boy’s uncle. Sequoyah was somewhat afraid to bring him bad news because he was known to easily lose his temper. His enormously big body, toned muscles and serious expression made him look even more fearsome - maybe his parents sensed the raw power within him since his very birth and that was the reason to give him the name Mohe (“the elk”). The brownish skin and black eyes were somehow inherited by his nephew - he had his posture, his jaw and eye shape, a tall (but slimmer than his uncle’s) body, painted from head to toes with various white, glowing-in-the-dark tattoos. They shone like small suns in the night - a technique that the tribe had come up with so nobody would get lost in the moonless hours of the night.
 
&#150; But, uncle, I saw something... - Sequoyah started talking a little bit nervously. - Something glowing and beautiful, like a spirit, yet so calm...

&#150; Don’t even mention spirits! - Mohe yelled back and grabbed angrily a piece of wood with unreadable writing on it. - In this tribe, we don’t mention the Evil! Do you not know what they do to our people? That they kill? That they steal? That they prey on us?

&#150; But...

&#150; Period!

For a moment the boy wanted to tell his uncle that what he saw during the storm didn’t seem like a predator at all, but then he decided wisely - to shut his mouth. He knew very well that his aunt and cousin had died in a storm like this, dragged away by a bunch of spirits into the wildest parts of the forest. But it was not like his parents had not vanished this way, too... And still, he decided not to put more salt in the wound and mind his own business.

&#150; Okay... - he murmured to himself and started walking away from Mohe to search for some wood or big leaves or whatever he could find for his new home.

Sequoyah tried to avoid everybody’s presence and went searching where he knew nobody would go - to the every edge of the wild forest. There was no wood at all, but plenty of fruits on the trees, which was also some kind of a help for the tribe.
 
He did everything in his power to shut all thoughts away and just climb up that tree to pick a few fruits when suddenly he realised his tattoos were not the only thing glowing in the dark - there was certainly something else around and the boy bet he could guess what it was. Sequoyah cautiously turned around, holding onto his bow as hard as he could, before something deeply inhuman revealed itself before his eyes. 

&#150; The spirit from the storm earlier... - he gasped at it in pure awe.

It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen - it didn’t have a specific shape but four limbs had grown out of his undefined trunk, its elongated neck finished into something like a face covered with a mask. But not a wooden mask like the ones they were making when going hunting. It was like a part of its own body, as if it was made of flesh or whatever matter this spirit was created of. And how serenely was it glowing in the most subtle, light colours...

&#150; Come. - Sequoyah heard its voice inside his head but the lips on his mask did not move even a little bit. - Come.

It repeated the command again like it was trying to hypnotize him. It was so beautiful, so lethally beautiful...  And before he could even take a step towards the spirit, somebody’s spear went right through it and its inhuman agonizing cry made Sequoyah wake up from the trance. The spirit struggled in pain and screamed even harder, then a second spear pierced its body. One last devastated whine, and it fell on the ground, lifeless, its light disappearing in thin air.  
 
The boy turned his eyes towards the spearholder and shouted at him in overwhelming rage, almost unconsciously:

&#150; Onakona! You didn’t have to do that! It was going to leave!

Onakona smiled a little bit but his dark eyes remained cold and distant.

&#150; You’re so young. That spirit was going to eat you alive.

&#150; It was calling me. Maybe it wanted to show me something…

&#150; Maybe - your deathbed... 

And with no further comment, the hunter took his spears out of the spirit’s body and went away, vanishing behind the trees. Sequoyah gazed at its lifeless body and solemnly said to himself:

&#150; But it was so pretty...

Within seconds he was gone as well, following Onakona back to the place where their village was being reconstructed.

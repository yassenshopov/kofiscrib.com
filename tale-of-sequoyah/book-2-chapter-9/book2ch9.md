# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 9: The Fury

&#150; Atsila. – he nudged her gently, making sure he wouldn’t frighten her in her sleep. – Atsila, it’s time to go.

She was sleeping so peacefully, tucked tight under her fur, probably having a dreamless sleep for once this past week. Her hair was messy, the paint on her face and shoulders – smudged, her lips – slightly parted, and eyelids tightly shut, but even this distant, laying on the bare ground in her old and already dirty clothes, it seemed so unfair to him to wake her up after everything she has gone through. A break was the least she deserved, but nobody here cared enough to let her sleep and Onakona’s rising temper this morning was enough of an edge to walk on.

&#150; Atsila, please. – he tried again by taking the fur slowly off her. – Come on, sleepyhead!
 
She didn’t move one bit and continued sleeping unbothered by the cold the fur was shielding her from. He took it off her shoulders and arms, not wanting to use aggressive methods, but if she went on this way, there would be no other choice for him…

And then something caught his attention. The sleeve on one of her hands was slightly pulled up and beneath it, even barely visible, he spotted an odd mark. A strange line of ink covering her right arm from wrist to elbow, weaving around her bare skin like unknown animal. The shape was rather unsymmetrical, resembling fire tongues licking her flesh, leaving their burning marks behind. It even smelled oddly – like ashes and wood, like trees being cast into the fire, like catastrophe, but before he could take a better look at it, she moved slightly to her right, hiding it unconsciously under her body.

&#150; Did I oversleep? – Atsila’s voice was sleepy and tired, but ready, waiting for a single word of command to quickly set her bag and go.

&#150; N-no. – Sequoyah stuttered a little bit, his tone harsher than he intended it to be, still not being able to process what he just saw. – But we must move quickly.

&#150; Okay. 

The girl sighed and quickly sat, rubbing her eyes in a desperate attempt to wake up faster and get to her senses. But Sequoyah couldn’t care less about her morning routine, his eyes were fixed on her right arm, the mark moving as she was extending her hand to reach for the other end of the fur. For a moment he thought that it was really moving on her skin, actually weaving up to her shoulder and back down to her fingers, the trace leaving fresh scars beneath it, etching itself deeper and deeper onto her skin. His intense stare must have intimidated Atsila because as soon as she noticed his feverish glare, she quickly pulled down her sleeves and turned her back on him while folding the fur inside her bag. 

*Where did she get this from?, he thought to himself, trying his best not to stare at her fingers again. And why haven’t I noticed before? Or is it new?*

&#150; Is there some fruit? – he heard her ask Kinunote timidly, while strapping her baldric around her back and thighs.

&#150; Yes, this one. – he handled her an odd looking, round fruit with an interesting green shade. – It’s sour. I hope we won’t die.

Atsila chuckled a little and took a bite, her face immediately turning into a funny, somehow disgusted grimace. But she swallowed it and kept on eating, probably reminding herself that the choice was either that, or nothing at all. 

*Where did that come from? Did she have it all along?*

Waya was ahead of the group, while the leather rope tied to her feet was laying in the hands of Toke. Onakona was looking rather irritable walking right by Toke’s side and that grumpy, fearful face of his, resembling a lot a cloudy rain, was the reason nobody dared approach him. Kinunote was exceptionally quiet that morning. Maybe because he was the only one here who had a thing to lose and was slowly starting to realize that the dangers on their way could one day be lethal, delaying his return to his wife with a whole eternity. Sequoyah was sympathetic to his soul torturing but still, his irritation with the boy’s naivety and weak will was overpowering him, making him unable to fully grasp the tragedy of his married life. Atsila was most probably feeling his longing, leaving behind for good her family, her birthplace, a lover, maybe… The though alone was making the hunter feel uncomfortable, the hairs on his back rising slightly and his mouth suddenly drying. The vision forming inside his mind was almost unbearable - this warrior girl beside him, bruised and tough, the Priestess herself, in the hands of a man, kissing her, hugging her, naked...

&#150; You look pale, child. – a low, almost as unpleasant voice took Sequoyah out of his terrible imagination trap. 
 
The boy hadn’t noticed but Waya was walking right beside him, the rope tied to her leg now laying in her own hands since Toke probably had had quite enough of her. Her presence was somehow distracting, banishing for a while his dark thoughts about the mark or Atsila’s lover…

&#150; I’m fine. – he cut her off, a little bit faster and hasher than he should have, maybe.

&#150; I can see your tormented soul, boy, don’t try to fool me. 

&#150; I said that I am fine.

A piercing, guttural laughter came from her mouth, echoing creepily inside Sequoyah’s head, making him want to crawl inside his shell and never come to the light. He hated it. Every single thing this woman said and did, every single thing she represented, but right now he needed her close for she was his only hope of escape at that moment. 

&#150; You think about her, don’t you? – the old woman insisted again, making him even more uncomfortable, given Atsila’s presence right in front of him.

Yes.

&#150; No. – Sequoyah was unwilling to admit the obvious.

&#150; I worry about her, too. I worry that besides your pure intentions, you will eventually break down and kill her. 

Her words were heavy, striking exactly where it hurts, crushing every little bone he had left in his body untouched from the burden he was wearing. The burden of being the murderer, the killer, the monster that despises its own self. The most painful part was that Waya was most probably right. Maybe despite his pure intentions, despite all his attempts to send Atsila away, to save her from this unfair fate, he would cast the girl into the flames, maybe even make her last days worse.
 
&#150; You know she is not fated to die. – the witch whispered, dragging the rope behind her, looking around cautiously for Onakona’s spying eyes.

&#150; She is not. Neither am I fated to be her murderer. – Sequoyah’s hands were gripping onto the fabric of his tunic, exactly below the strap of his baldric on his thigh, and his voice was low, so low that it could be easily mistaken with the howling wind around them.

&#150; Then what is it that you are thinking so much about? Here she is doomed, and you know it. 

&#150; Keep your voice low…

&#150; You know that if she stays here her gift will be wasted, a gift so rare and powerful. Why do you want to stripe her off it?

&#150; I said keep your…

&#150; You are going to have her blood all over your hands if she stays with your people. Is this what you want – a guilt for all your miserable life? I know you don’t. That’s why you saved me, didn’t you? You have guessed by now where she belongs – with me!

&#150; Enough! – Sequoyah heard his voice distant, echoing furiously inside his whole body, and before he could realize he was shouting at Waya, while everyone had stopped at their places to look at him, he lashed out again:

&#150; I have had enough of your useless chanting! I can’t have a minute piece of mind because you somehow decided to torment me with all your hollow, meaningless threats! I wish I didn’t risk everyone’s lives just to save you, and trust me, I regret every day and every night that fact that I didn’t let the wolves eat you alive!

Dead silence fell upon the whole group. Nobody dared talk, let alone move or breathe. Sequoyah’s wrath was still going strong inside him, the blood rushing in his veins, his pulse like a running horse and his breathing hard and heavy. He was panting, struggling to contain himself inside his own skin and not take out his blade off the baldric. His senses were stubbed out by his anger and fury, and for a split second he felt like he was the only one around, the only one dealing with the guilt tripping of the witch. Completely unaware of all the people around him, he made a step towards her, the curtain of rage falling in front of his eyes and driving him towards pure madness. The metal handle of the knife was burning against his skin, begging him to take it out and use it. But before he could make another step, a tight grip on his wrist made the illusion of Waya’s blood irrigating the soil beneath their feet quickly disappear. And at that moment all his world was narrowed to, were these bright, fearless black eyes of hers…

&#150; Come to your sense. – Atsila’s serious voice was stinging his whole body, making him feel nauseous, disgusted with himself. – Breathe and think. 

Her gaze was unyieldingly fixed on his face, making him indulge in her calm, unbothered expression. But for him it was obvious that deep down she was judging him, judging his short temper and even so well disguised, he recognized the metal tint inside her irises. Shame, deep shame and disgust suddenly splashed him, threatening to drown him with their intensity. He bowed his head down, the feelings overwhelming him, his words repeating inside his mind again and again, but just as he was about to apologise, the cold and thin fingers wrapped around his wrist made the fire inside him burn once again with glowing red flames. The tattoo was spread to her fingers, now marked with swirls and lines of dark ink, moving continuously around her palm, mocking him.
 
And just like that he quickly took his hand abruptly off her grip, hissing the words in her face:

&#150; Don’t you dare lecture me. – the regret was coming after him sooner than he though it would but still, his mouth was faster. – You are the same as me. 

And without saying anything more, the hunter turned his back on the Priestess, headed forward completely unabashed, the bloodrush banging inside his ears so loud that it was preventing him from hearing even his own thoughts. And that’s how he wanted it to be, at least for now. Quiet.

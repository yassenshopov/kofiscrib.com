# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 3: The Moonless Night

That night nobody could sleep, let alone rest for a while. Except for Onakona - he surely was as though as nails since he could sleep so peacefully in such a place. He was either brave to recklessness or in a way feeling in control of the situation at every given moment.

I can't believe the confidence, Sequoyah thought and his hand gripped the bow even harder. He must be in a secret alliance with the spirits here... or with magic even more ancient...
 
&#150; Is it dawn already? - Atsila asked gravely. - I want to get away from this place.

Chapter 3: The Moonless Night
&#150; It's still night. Can't you see the stars? - he replied a little bit too harshly which he immediately regretted.

The girl only murmured a few incomprehensible words and yet again turned her eyes towards the smoldering fire as if she was talking to the stones and charcoals. As if she was whispering them her prophesies, using them as witnesses to what will forever be buried in the forest's memory. On her right, Toke and Kinunote were watching them restlessly, not missing a single word they spoke, a single step they took... The forest wasn't the only prison Sequoyah and Atsila were locked into.

&#150; Are you alright? - the boy asked her without lifting his eyes off his bow.
 
She moved a little bit to her left, snugging deeper into her leather coat.

&#150; No.

&#150; Can I... Can I help?

Sequoyah finally turned his vision towards her and pierced her with a determined look on his face. Atsila smiled bitterly and threw a rock into the place where the fire had been lit.

&#150; Unless you want to kill me here and now, I don't think so.

Toke and Kinunote were following closely their conversation, maybe more of pure curiosity than spite. Her words were cutting, vicious and painful to hear - she was afraid but covering her reeking skin with bitterness. The boy couldn't have expected anything less of the granddaughter of elder Adohi but still hoped that she could spare him the vile comments about her death.

&#150; Come. - he told her.

It was not a question, not an invitation. It was an order. She looked at him confused and for a moment he saw there, deep down, a little insecure and scared girl hidden inside, wanting to be soothed. The two awake guards' faces visibly became more severe and tense. The men gave them a warning look but didn't stop them from going hand in hand a little bit farther from the bivouac into the woods. When they finally lost sight of Toke and Kinunote, they both stopped and let go of each other.

&#150; What did you see? - Sequoyah didn't bother procrastinating the main question.
 
&#150; I want to forget it, how come you want to remind me of it? - her answer was no less straightforward.

&#150; Atsila. What did you see?

&#150; I don't want to...

&#150; Atsila, I am trying to understand what is going to attack us. How am I going to protect you if I don't know what it is?!

&#150; You are not here to protect me, you are here to kill me! - she snapped back and immediately put her hand on her mouth as if she had said something terrible.

It was terrible, indeed - his heart skipped a beat, causing the air inside his lungs to suddenly disappear. It was like she had kicked him right in the stomach - he barely contained himself to not whine in pain and disappointment.

&#150; That's not fair - he managed to say after a few moments. - You chose me. You chose me to do it!

&#150; I know, I know, I'm sorry...

&#150; It's not fair because you pushed this fate upon me, you wanted to make me a murderer!

&#150; I'm sorry, I didn't...

&#150; You didn't what?! You didn't do it?

Atsila fell quiet for a while. Her eyes were so desperate, so painfully afraid and full of horrors that it made his insides turn around and wish he hadn't been born. She turned around trying to wipe away her tears with her palm and after a minute of silence, whispered:

&#150; It was a dog. A giant scary dog, as big as a horse and as vicious as a tiger. With long canines and a mouth full of foam. His head will be on my throat. - she almost broke down. - Please, don't let it eat me alive... please...
 
The girl couldn't keep herself intact anymore and buried her face in her hands, probably still seeing this terrible vision on the inside of her eyelids. Sequoyah felt conflicted - he was so deadly mad at her and at the same time couldnâ€™t watch her being so miserable. He wanted to go to her and comfort her, to tell her everything will be gone and she won't die but at the same time, he wanted her to feel what it was to be obligated to kill your best friend, your closest one, and then live with the guilt all his life... Bit she was going to be the one sacrificing her life for some imaginary gods that only the elders actually worshiped - she was going to die for something that she didn't even believe in. It was enough of torture. As he made a step towards her, determined to calm her down, she shook her head as if some new fresh powers had flowed inside her body and she had managed to pull herself together as fast as that. His arm, floating in the air, aimed towards her, slowly fell down back to his side while she sniffed away the last traits of tears.

&#150; We shall be on guard as much as possible. I can't tell when it's going to happen. - were Atsila's last words before she headed back to the bivouac.

Soon enough her guardian followed her, as quietly as possible, putting the stone mask yet again on his face.

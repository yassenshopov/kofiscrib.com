# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 5: The Priestess

Sequoyah slowly turned around to see what or who was standing behind him, what force or element had banished these bloodthirsty animals, just to see Atsila's feverish eyes looking straight through him, her hand stretched out like she was reaching for something far ahead. Her head was tilted oddly to the side and her body seemed rather tired and thin.

&#150; Oh priestess… - the woman in the dirt started humming quietly, slowly lifting her head from between her hands. - Oh power inhuman…

The next moment Atsila was already lying in Sequoyah's hands, exhausted to the bones, not being able to move neither her limbs nor her head. Her eyes were distant, reflecting a blue, metallic luster while she was mouthing a few words very quietly.

“*I don't know what I did*” - neither did anyone.

Onakona, Toke and Kinunote had slowly jumped down from the tree, stepping closer to the place where the now-dead fire stick had burned a few seconds ago. They looked so cautious, especially Onakona - so devilishly careful not to summon whatever power had obsessed Atsila's body and soul, whatever power she had hidden between these eyes.

&#150; Oh priestess of the night, oh we have found you at last - the woman started getting up from the ground, singing louder and louder, getting closer to the girl, laying lifelessly in Sequoyah's arms. - Oh power inhuman, a hurricane of souls, oh my only goddess and master, we have found you at last! 

Her little arms and face were all wrinkled, her body hunched and stiff but her eyes were sparkling with madness, with such a graceful reverence - like a devotee in front of their only beloved god. The clothes she was wearing were old and worn out, her boots almost falling apart and a few of her fingers had gone dark blue, most probably from the cold out here and the lack of gloves. But what made her such an interesting sight to behold was her dark brown skin unlike any other Sequoyah had seen before. The color was rich and velvet, like mud and night, like dark wood untouched by time and nature.

&#150; Priestess, I am just a humble servant of yours, just a humble servant on you orders - she continued her chant, already on her knees in front of them both. - Oh finally you chose to reveal yourself before us!

&#150; What are you talking about? - Onakona's harsh voice was the first to express pit load everybody's rising question.

&#150; The girl… - her voice was husky and stinging but filled with emotion. - The girl is the chosen.

&#150; Yes, she is. To die.

&#150; No, no, she cannot die! She cannot die! She is the Priestess, she cannot die!

Atsila slowly turned herself towards the old woman, inspected carefully her face, her desperate impression and bony hands and gathering every energy she had accumulated for the past few minutes, she spoke slowly:

&#150; Who are you? 

The rescued woman dared look her in the eyes only once and then immediately looked back to the ground, her hands extended towards the rising moon in the sky.

&#150; I had a name long ago before I ran into the woods. Now when I'm one with the trees and the soil, my name is Waya. And I have been searching for you.

&#150; What are you talking about? - Sequyah had no nerves left to wait for her to reach the answer of the main question they all have been trying to guess inside their heads.

&#150; The girl you are holding in your hands, young man, is the Priestess. The Lady Spirit. The fortune-teller. The gifted among you. The one my tribe had been worshiping for ages. She is the new reincarnation.
 
&#150; This is nonsense. - Onakona was absolutely not convinced.

&#150; You might think so, but her power is beyond your understanding! - Waya scolded him and quickly returned her attention towards Atsila. - She banished the wolves. She made them back away. She has control over these creatures of the dark, even though not very developed yet. 

&#150; No… - Atsila tried speaking but her eyes were becoming more and more distant, lost somewhere between her thoughts. - That wasn't me. A force came… and overtook my body. That was not me.

&#150; You called that force. It is part of you, a yet untrained part of you that stays hidden in the shadows until you seek her help. - the old woman looked terribly like the elders, talking with such passion and devotion, such truly unbelievable spirit after the attack.

&#150; Enough of that chatter! - Kinunote was obviously getting irritated by Waya's unlogical words. - The wolves might return, we shouldn't stay here.

&#150; They won't return, child. - the woman replied dryly. - Thanks to the girl.
 
Everyone fell quiet yet again. Mainly because nobody had what to say so they all preferred the uncomfortable silence that layed between them, stretching her poisonous claws of dread.

Waya slowly approached Atsila, taking her hand and finally holding her glance for more than a mere second.

&#150; I can help you. I am your servant, your worshiper. - she whispered. - I can teach you to control your visions. 

Sequoyah's gut turned upside down only from the thought of her receiving another vision after what happened the last time. Whoever that woman was, however she had survived by herself out in the wild, whatever she had done before - if she was able to help Atsila control her gift, that would mean she was staying with the group for a long time whether Onakona liked it or not.

In no time a new bivouac was made - fire burning bright at the center and a few unfortunate small animals baking on top of it. Waya was eating like she hadn't seen food for ages while the other could barely take a bite. Except for Onakona, but he was a heartless brutal killer and nothing could reach him emotionally except if it wasn't related to the hunt. He didn't seem worried or confused but his eyes were spying. Spying on Waya very carefully, in a most discrete manner, waiting for her to make a move, to say a word, to reveal a secret. 

“I need some sleep” was the last thing the granddaughter of elder Adohi said before drifting into heavy memoryless repose, cuddled up inside a warm panther leather.

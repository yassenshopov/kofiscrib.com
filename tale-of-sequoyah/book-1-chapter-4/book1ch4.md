# BOOK 1: The Beginning
## Chapter 4: The Chosen One

Her face was almost unrecognizable - eyes sore from crying, the tears leaving notches on the white paint she applied every day, lips paler than ever, her slightly snub nose runny and red. She was finally having some color on her face rather than the white from the paint but it was so tragic, so heart-breaking that Sequoyah turned his eyes away from her. 

All the warriors were aligned in front of the Tent of the Elders, making two perfectly straight lines while waiting for the victim to show up. Mohe had woken them up from their deep sleep in such a rush that the anxiety inevitably placed its finger on them. They were only told that the victim had been chosen in the Tent but were refused further explanation. The less they knew, the better, as Mohe said darkly with his brows frowning. Sequoyah had a bad feeling about all of this - the sacrifice by itself was something he could accept but offering a person he most probably knew was making the hairs on his back stand. 

The moment he saw her there, the moment he saw the smudged white paint on her face, applied multiple times in a desperate but failed attempt to cover the marks the tears had left on her cheeks, his blood ran cold. It felt like his brain shut down and his body was left paralyzed. He suddenly forgot how to talk, how to walk, even how to breathe. Atsila was looking like horror itself - red eyes, trembling lips, she was obviously trying to keep it together but was failing terribly. It was painful to even look at her and everyone immediately felt uncomfortable. Her glare was wildering around like a hurt animal looking for the hunter that shot the arrow. The warrior tried so hard to avoid her eyes, to protect himself from her desperate glare, but somehow she caught the right moment and their eyes met for a second. Atsila was speaking soundlessly something incomprehensible for the rest and for a moment he thought it was his name. She was calling him for help. Her only hope, her only salvation. His heart clutched in his chest and before he could even understand what he was doing, he broke the stare. The warrior wanted to help her, to shout to everyone that her head couldn’t go to the log, to fight the guards around her and take her away, far away from here. But he knew that was impossible. Absolutely impossible. But her eyes were still begging him for it. 

&#150; Atsila - elder Kanuna began gravely - daughter of the late Chetoki, granddaughter of Elder Atohi, confirm your identity! 

“Please, deny, please, deny!”. Sequoyah was praying to her inside his mind. 

After one shaky breath, she began, tears falling down her face: 

&#150; I confirm to be Atsila, daughter of the late Chetoki, granddaughter of Elder Atohi. 

&#150; Do you accept to be presented as an offering to Uku? 

&#150; I don’t seem... to have another choice. - she stuttered there, trying to suppress another wave of tears. 

&#150; Then, with your consent and permission, you, Atsila, are chosen to be an offering for the God of the Flowing Water Uku. Who do you choose to execute the ritual? 

They all fell silent. A dead, terrifying silence once again made Sequoyah’s blood run cold. The boys and men by his side were looking at their feet ashamed and scared to lift their heads up. He was the only one standing still, hid head high above the others, trying not to look at her in the eyes. 

Please, let it not be me, he was talking to himself. Please, please, not me, please...

Another burst of tears broke the silence and sent shivers down the lines. The always serious and expressionless woman was now looking like a scared little girl, terrified of dying, of the unknown and the pain. 

Not me, not me... 

Atsila was losing it, she couldn’t keep herself intact anymore and before she completely broke down on the ground, her once again shaky voice rose above the whistling wind: 

&#150; I choose... - she stuttered. - I choose Sequoyah, nephew of elder Mohe. 

&#150; No... - he gasped and did his best to suppress the anger that was rising inside him.

&#150; I will not allow this! - Mohe’s voice was serious, dangerously tense. 

&#150; You do not have the luxury to have an opinion on the matter! - elder Yota fired back at him. 

&#150; I decided to stay neutral in the discussion and so will my nephew! 

&#150; You are late to say this. The girl already chose her executor. - Atohi interrupted as calm as ever. 

&#150; Elder Atohi!

&#150; Don’t give me that look, Mohe. At least your nephew will come back to us alive and enlightened by the forest and the gods. 

The uncle didn’t say a word after that but his eyes were burning bright with anger and fury. 

&#150; Onakona, Toke, Kinunote - you will be their guards. - continued the elder. - We need to make sure they will reach the Holy Mountain and will execute the ritual. Otherwise, everything is lost for us. 

Within seconds everybody was dismissed and the only people in front of the Tent left were Sequoyah, Atsila, and Atohi, who was quietly talking to his granddaughter. Probably some soothing words. Words of courage. Sequoyah wanted to get lost, to disappear in thin air. He was angry and, at the same time, scared. He wanted to rewind this whole scene, this whole night. It was a true nightmare. 

&#150; Sequoyah - the elder called him. - Please, make it quick. 

His words were literally soaked in pools of pain and sorrow. In front of his people, it was his duty that was speaking, but now, in front of them both, it was the loving grandparent that was begging him to make one clear cut and send his little girl to the benevolent gods. 

&#150; I... I promise. - he stuttered for the first time in his life. 

For the first time in his life, he wished to not have been born. Ever. 
 
&#150; Good. - was the only response he got before the man disappeared in the mist that was surrounding the village. 

The moment he went out of sight, Atsila broke down in tears, fell on her knees, and cupped her face in her hands. She could finally let it all out and her whines and pleadings were echoing so heartbreakingly around them both. Sequoyah clenched his fists in a desperate attempt to suppress his anger but still, he could not keep it deep down anymore. 

&#150; Why? Why me?! - he started shouting at her. - Tell me, why do you want to torture me?!

But all she could do was cry behind her hands. 

&#150; Look at me, Atsila. - no response. - Look at me! 

She lifted her head slightly, her eyes blood red with tears. The white paint was almost wiped out of her face but she had gotten so pale that it didn’t seem that way. If Sequoyah didn’t know what had happened, he would say his friend was looking kind of fierce. And still, she had no courage to speak to him.  

&#150; Talk! - the warrior shouted once again and started walking towards her. - Talk to me! Tell me! Why did you curse me with the fate to watch you die?!
 
Her lower lip was trembling so hard that whatever she was saying was completely incomprehensible to Sequoyah. 

&#150; You owe it to me! - he knelt to her and as he grabbed her by the shoulders, shook her with some furious, untamed power. 

&#150; Why do you want me to kill you?! Why did you choose me?! I don’t want to watch you die - I don’t want to take away your life and you know it! Then why did you do it? Why me?! 
 
She finally dared to look at her friend in the eyes. It made him shut his mouth in that very second. 

&#150; Because I wouldn’t want to die of the hand of a stranger. - she almost whispered. - I want... I want to see a familiar face... a face I’ve loved before I die... and I have nobody but you left in this world... 

As slowly as they had dried, the tears immediately returned and started pouring from her eyes like summer rain. She searched for Sequoyah’s hand while trying to cover her face with the other. He was still angry with her but started to feel more and more overwhelmed with sympathy for her destiny. In the end, she was just a scared kid - just like him. He took her hand and pulled her into his embrace. He didn’t have the nerve to talk about himself anymore or to try to call her out. Sequoyah just stood there, hugging his friend for the first time, trying not to fall apart like her. 

*“She should die... You cannot help her. And still, you will hate yourself forever if you don’t try...”* he thought to himself while the first rays of light were starting to dance in the early morning sky, announcing the break of dawn.

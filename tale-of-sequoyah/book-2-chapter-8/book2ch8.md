# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 8: The Encounter

It was insanely surreal when Atsila opened her eyes and saw the subtle moon white light surrounding her.

*Priestess*, the whisper was still echoing inside her mind, deafening her with its intensity. Priestess, here we are.

She had a vision about a spirit that came to her but rather to be aggressive and angry as they were all taught to believe all spirits were, it was calm, almost frighteningly calm, floating in the air around her with that strange expressionless mask. 

*Cautious. Be cautious. Nobody is your friend.*

Atsila could barely regulate her breathing, her lungs panting and struggling for some fresh air. Without realizing, she had tucked her whole body – head included, under the warm fur during the night. Maybe because of the vision or because of the cold, she was not exactly sure. The girl took it carefully off, still feeling dizzy and disoriented. Everyone around her was asleep and she almost couldn’t believe that the viper Onakona needed to sleep and was not on guard for some unknown threat. With relief she saw that Sequoyah had taken his fur closer to hers, holding onto a knife, ready to fight off everyone and everything. The girl hadn’t woken him up with her heavy breathing which made her feelings a little bit bitter-sweet. She really wanted to share what she just saw with him, but maybe it was better this way. It was nothing too serious anyway. Just a spirit talking to her, just a small very harmful but calm spirit telling her to be cautious of her friends.

*Should I be cautious of you, love?*, she thought to herself but quickly shook her head in disapproval and turned around, trying to reach for her water mesh – she was thirsty and confused, fighting the urge to throw up everything she had consumed that day.
 
And the moment her eyes met its endless hollows, etched in the inhuman mask on its face, sheer terror ran through her veins and made her feet disobedient, her hands shaky and her face unable to look away from its graceful yet terrifying aura. The moon white light its body was emitting was enchanting but dangerous, bringing from inside her the need to scream her lungs out yet again. But she fought it. She fought the urge to wake up everyone and kill it on the spot, deciding it is best to just slowly back away from it, maybe to hide somewhere. Maybe it wasn’t really seeing her clearly.

*I see you, Priestess, its inhuman voice echoed inside her head once more, the absolute same as in her vision. I come with peace*.

Atsila couldn’t believe her ears, or her imagination – she still wasn’t exactly sure if this was all a dream or not. The spirit was trying to initiate contact, referring to her as “The Priestess”. What would it possibly want from her? And was it reading her thoughts and answering them?

*Yes, I do hear you. I smell your fear but also sense your curiosity, the creature continued. My brothers have tried to talk to your people but in vain. You are the second from mankind to listen.*

Before Atsila could realize what she was doing, the adrenaline and fear beaming inside of her got her on her feet, facing the spirit straight in the face, but still being a lot smaller than it. The light coming from its body was so bright that she had to close her eyes a little bit, still not losing it out of sight.

*Don’t run. I came here with a message.*

At this point, the girl was staying absolutely still, only her wrists and ankles shaking. Her one hand had grabbed the knife on her back just in case the spirit had other plans for this visit and her other was stretched out in front of her, taking a defensive pose. She could hear the blood rush banging inside her body, filling her ears with its deafening roar but still was able to hold her guard on. As afraid and unprepared she was, the poor fate she had in her powers to control such creatures was holding her standing and seemingly unwilling to back off.

&#150; What message do you bring me, spirit? – Atsila whispered, her breath leaving a trace in the freezing night air.

*I am not just a spirit, kid. I am a thousand years old! I rarely communicate with your ignorant kind!*, its anger was very clear through its words, but it seemingly kept its composure. 

&#150; I… I apologise. – her lip trembled a little.

*I came here to tell you to beware. Darkness comes slowly upon you. A storm.*

&#150; What do you mean by darkness? A flood or earthquake?

But it remained silent, leaving Atsila some time to think. Was another flood coming their way? Or was it metaphorical? Was a disaster brought upon their heads and by who? Her?

*Yes and no, Priestess, the old spirit suddenly said, tilting its expressionless head forward a little bit as if you make their contact a little bit more personal. Beware, Priestess. You are forever connected to the spirit world. Sleep with your eyes open.*

And saying no more, it started moving backwards, its aura getting weaker and weaker.

&#150; But wait! – the girl unconsciously dropped the knife she was holding behind her back, extending both her hands even farther ahead, trying to reach the creature, to hold it a second more.

But before Atsila could even blink, the spirit was already gone, leaving no trace behind, no evidence for its presence right by her bed that night. The girl stood there for a while, her hands slowly falling to her sides and her head going through every word the creature had told her.

*Beware, Priestess. Darkness comes slowly upon you.*

But what darkness? Was it a natural disaster – a flood, or an animal attack maybe? Or maybe and earthquake so strong that they had never seen in their entire twenty-one years old long life? But if it was so, why would a spirit care about any of them? Why would it come to her trying to warn her about it when exactly her kind was killing brutally every spirit they saw, murdering them on the spot without hesitation? Onakona himself had killed quite a few spirits, left alone Toke. It simply was not making sense.

Be cautious. Nobody is your friend.

Maybe the spirit was trying to warn her and only her. Even if she didn’t want to admit it, Atsila was of some importance to the spirit world, considering her gift and abilities. There were a lot of missing pieces about that fact but trying to guess them exactly at that moment would have been madness. Maybe she really had some form of a connection with these wild creatures, given that the spirit was calling her “Priestess” as well. 

Sleep with your eyes open.

&#150; You really should sleep with your eyes open, child. – a familiar voice quickly got her out of her trance, scaring her so much that for a second she felt like somehow all the air inside her lungs had vanished and she couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move or think, simply choking on her fright.

She had most probably mumbled the last few words in her feverish trance, thinking no one else was awake. But as it seemed, she was mistaken. Before she could come to her senses, one hand pressed against her chest, Atsila turned around to face the tree where Waya’s foot was tied. The old woman was looking at her, eyes wide open and curious, so creepily curious. She seemed like being awake for a long time now, a silent spectator of the happenings that night. 
 
*Did she… see everything?*, the girl thought to herself but quickly buried her fear deep down inside her, deciding to play dumb and pretend nothing had happened just a minute ago.

&#150; What? – Atsila asked, choking a little bit on her words since she was still lacking her breath.

&#150; I see right through you, Priestess. – Waya calmly replied. – No need to pretend in front of me. 

&#150; I have no idea what you are talking about.

The Priestess’ answer was sharp and sudden, almost too sudden. Now more than ever it was obvious that she was hiding something and clearly, the savage woman knew all about it. But it was easier to play along the role she initially decided to follow so Atsila simply didn’t say anything back and made a step towards her bed, craving a peaceful, dreamless sleep that she hadn’t had in at least a week.

&#150; They talk to me sometimes, too. But never the old ones, only the younger and curious.

And just like that the girl froze right where she stood, her back turned to the crazy wild woman tied to the tree. The dumbstruck mask Atsila had chosen to wear suddenly fell, making her shiver from head to toe. This damned wolf woman was always on guard, prying everything and everyone so she wouldn’t miss anything around her and somehow always knew what to say and how to hurl your whole composure into the flames. Atsila was losing her control, slowly falling apart between the cracks of her cold-blooded temper but still managed to keep herself intact and not looking back at the witch’s eyes.
 
&#150; They once reached to me a lot more than now, I guess they have finally found their Priestess. – Waya continued naturally. – You are their bridge to this would, an uniter. They need you and you need them since your power comes from them.

&#150; Why did they talk to you exactly? – the granddaughter of elder Adohi asked a little bit harsher than she wished to. 

&#150; I was a lost soul in the forest with quite the knowledge about gods, priestesses, and rituals, I guess I was somehow a useful messenger before they sensed your aura. They found the real one they need to send their warnings. – she paused for a second, clearing her throat, her voice sounding silkier than before. – It is a good thing that they found you, trust me. I can tell you a thing or two about their kind. 

*I don’t want anything from you!*, the girl heard her inner voice scream inside her head, making her shiver once again. 

She wrapped her hands around her body, suddenly feeling the cold wind stinging the bare skin on her face and hands as harsh as possible. Atsila was used to the cold but still despised it with all the fierce hate her soul had stored throughout the years. It was definitely not the time for the cold season to begin, especially when they were in the Forest, equipped with only one or two furs, a pair of clothes, and knives. But what was the matter anyway, she was going to die in a few weeks, probably even days…

&#150; Save your breath for someone whose life will last. – the girl replied bitterly, turning her head slightly back so she could catch a glimpse of the witch in the back. – The spirits will have to find another bridge to walk onto.

And without further ado, Atsila took her fur by the end and dragged it closer to Sequoyah, whose peaceful breathing was the only thing that could calm her racing thoughts and rising grief inside her heart.

# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 6: The Gift

They all woke up to the sound of branches breaking and a sharp, sudden scream:

&#150; Get your hands off me! 

Sequoyah quickly jumped on his feet, not fully awake yet but cautious. The rest of the men had woken up too, even though Toke was still laying on the ground tucked in very comfortably under a thick grey wolf skin. Onakona was already holding a knife, looking around like he was searching for his newest prey while Kinunote had an odd look on his face, something between confusion and sleepy disorientation, but still managed to stand up and look around.

&#150; Atsila. – Sequoyah recognized her voice immediately. – Something’s wrong. I don’t see her.
 
And indeed, her bed was empty and so chaotic that the boy couldn’t believe his eyes. Atsila was such a strict person especially when it comes to her belongings – she wouldn’t leave such a scene behind just like that. Right now, it was a complete mess – the animal skins and furs were scattered all around, branches everywhere, leaves and grass all over her baggage and knives, that someone would think she had been…

&#150; Dragged out of it. - Onakona stated coldly once everything clicked inside their brains. – She had been dragged asleep out of her bed.

&#150; The wolves? – Toke suggested while getting up.

&#150; I doubt. – Kinunote answered without hesitation. – I see no wolf footprints.

And he was right – there was no trace of animal presence. No footprints, no hair, no nothing. But there was something even more suspicious about the trace left from Atsila’s bed leading to the thick line of trees behind them – the small, slightly visible pieces of already rotting cloth next to it…

&#150; Waya! – the young hunter roared in anger and as he quickly picked up and strapped his baldric, ran without a second though between the enormously big trees.

He could feel that the rest of the men had grasped the situation too, as Onakona’s demanding voice reached his back, shaking him with such a force, that one would assume an earthquake had just occurred beneath their feet. Some orders had been given and just like that, for a second or two, the huntsmen were all running through the forest, searching for a trace of the missing girl.
 
If only I knew this woman was crazy, I wouldn’t have run to save her from the wolves, Sequoyah thought to himself but quickly brushed off his irritation with himself, trying to focus on finding his friend.

There was no sight of her – just a small, barely visible trace on the damp soil, quickly fading and turning back into mud beneath his feet. He was cursing inside his head, sending to hell all gods and spirits, but still listening carefully for a sound, even just a breath to guide him. His pace was fast, faster than lightning itself, searching and listening, everything terrifyingly well resembling a hunt session. Waya was just an old woman, she was even a little bit hunched, how fast could she run in the forest while holding another struggling to escape woman? But still, she had the advantage of knowing the woods better and longer, probably memorizing all the small paths and hideouts. 

&#150; Sequoyah, I smell her around. – a voice was heard suddenly over his shoulder and the boy quickly turned around to see Toke coming from behind a tree. – She cannot be far ahead.

&#150; I really hope so. 

Sequoyah’s words were sharp and bitter, full of disappointment and tension. He could barely contain himself within his own skin – his anger and worry overtaking him for the first time since his choosing for Atsila’s killer. It was ironical if one thinks about it. They were all trying to find and save the granddaughter of elder Adohi only to kill her themselves later.

Toke’s light movements around him suddenly brought the young hunter to reality. He was so swift and light, running on his toes so silently and discretely around. No wonder he was among the best hunters in the tribe. His knives always sharp, his mind always clear and his actions always perfectly motioned. He was around thirty, hadn’t married even once because as he put it one night while being with Sequoyah next to the fire “the hunt is all I can focus on – it is my whole life”. In fact, he was simply a prisoner inside his analytical mind, living his life through the eyes of someone else standing nearby. On a distance. And that exactly was making him the best cold-blooded killer in the whole tribe – no attachments, no feelings, little to no sympathy. He was no less merciless than Onakona but a little bit less expressive. Dark. Not so bothered with other people around him while Onakona was spying and spying, careful and sly as a fox. The wolf pack would have probably suited Toke better than the human one he was stuck in…
 
&#150; Hands off me! – another scream made them both run straight towards the source. 

She was close. Real close. But the slope towards the small hill was sharp, and the trees were so dense that if Waya wanted to go unnoticed behind them, she would easily achieve it. Tree after tree, after tree, everything around was so wild and untamed that Sequoyah started worrying slightly about the spirits. What if they appear here, when they were unprotected and unfocused? But he couldn’t allow himself to go into a panic state because like that he would be of no use to anyone. And still, what would happen if the spirits found them here? Or the wolf pack? Would the two of them be enough to hold them back? And what if…

&#150; Sequoyah, move!

Toke was already cutting the high grass and tree branched laying low, almost to the ground out of their way, moving unrealistically fast forward. Sequoyah realized that all his thoughts and fears had paralyzed him, stiffening him to the bones. But he couldn’t afford the luxury to stay and think quietly – he had to go and go fast. As quickly as he got into the fearful trance, he snapped out of it and followed the hunter without any hesitation straight between the trees, up on the hill. 

&#150; Don’t bite me!

A flicker between the trees and suddenly the shadows of two very familiar figures showed next to a bunch of big roots.

&#150; This is for your own good, they will kill you!

Waya’s voice echoed over the grass, over the trees and wild nature and hit directly into Sequoyah’s heart, carving these exact words inside his brain. He kept moving, running toward where the two women were obviously fighting, but still his mind wasn’t there. He did everything by habit but his thoughts were wandering far ahead, so far that he could barely catch up with them.

&#150; Stupid girl, come with me, stop fighting! – Waya shouted again, her anger and irritation clear in her voice.
 
What if this is better? If she comes with us, I will be forced to kill her, the boy thought to himself, while jumping over a suspiciously looking shrub, landing with Toke just behind the witch’s back. What if this woman can actually teach her how to live out here in the wild? What if she is the path that Atsila should take – not towards death but towards freedom?

Without realising, he had reached Atsila, grasping both her hands in his, hugging her tight and shielding her with his own body from the eyes of the wild woman. Turning his head around he could see Toke pushing tightly her right arm behind her back and holding his sharp blade right next to her throat.

&#150; Make one more step and I’ll slither your throat. – he said low, threatening the woman struggling to escape his grip.

What if she can lead Atsila to her freedom?

Atsila in his hands was trembling like a leaf on the wind, looking so small and fragile but her spirit still strong, still unwilling to bend to someone else’s commands. The fear in her eyes was slowly melting, replaced by something Sequoyah couldn’t quite recognize – a mixture of relief, sorrow and grief. 

&#150; There she is! – somebody hummed right beside him, coming from behind of a mighty oak. 

What if the girl can develop her gift outside the tribe, out here in the wild? What if she can lead a happy life, a longer life without us?

&#150; Onakona, what shall we do with her? – Toke said expressionlessly, his voice strikingly lacking emotion.

&#150; What do you think she deserves? – he replied with such hate and triumph that one could easily punch him the face for it. – Maybe we should skin her alive?

&#150; Don’t be like this. – Kinunote quietly said behind his back, his mind unable to imagine this kind of view.

And indeed, Sequoyah had seen it only once when he was very little, maybe around five or six years old. They had skinned alive one of the elders for blasphemy and dark bargains with the forest spirits. He wanted to make them invade the village through black magic and make himself their rightful ruler. What a fool for he never knew just how powerful these creatures were and how strong-willed they were. Elder Adohi assigned the torture himself. 

What if she doesn’t belong with us? 

&#150; I need to get the girl out of your hands! – Waya said while trying to take control of her body again. – All her potential, all her power – it will be gone!

She is right.

&#150; You are wrong. She is the chosen victim, and she will die. – Toke stated cold-bloodedly.

&#150; Just not by my hands and not here. – Onakona continued his thought with a tint of satisfaction. – However much you try, you cannot change fate, witch.

Before the woman could respond, the knife was pressed even harder onto her neck, cutting her a little and causing a small drop of blood to fall down her neck and inside her clothes. 
 
She can lead her out. Maybe us. Maybe she can guide Atsila towards her future, and maybe me as well…

&#150; The spirits might return. We should get going. – Kinunote timidly interrupted Sequoyah’s thoughts. 

Onakona was indulging in every minute of power and triumph he had over Waya, every moment in which he was dominating her strong and fierce will. Disgusting monster, he was so irritated that somebody had interrupted this pleasant moment that his face twisted into an angry mask, looking towards the boy beside him with abhorrence and sheer evil. He would most probably indulge in the scene of Atsila’s motionless body lying on the cold stones while her blood drains from her throat…

&#150; Spare her. – Sequoyah suddenly said. – Spare her life.

&#150; And why? – Onakona didn’t look concerned or worried at all – he was simply enjoying this situation too much.

&#150; She… she has been living in the woods for a long time, right? – Kinunote surprisingly responded. – She surely knows the woods better. 

&#150; And can show us the way to the mountain. – the young hunter finished. – The safest and fastest way. 

&#150; We can handle that on our own. – the spiteful man replied. – We don’t need a savage woman, dragged by a pack of wolves to tell me how to do my part!

&#150; But it will be much more effortlessly. – Toke admitted. – And efficient. They have a point.

Atsila was silent, almost too silent, her whole body stiff and rigid. She was still breathing a little heavy, her eyes darting around, scanning everybody’s expressions while her right hand was covering half of her face. She was obviously in pain but was hiding it pretty well, masking the pain waves with a few sharp inhales. Maybe she had a bruise on her cheek or was too afraid to show her bare face without the white pain on it. 

An angry sigh.

&#150; Fine. Her life shall be her gift tonight. – Onakona exhaled through gritted teeth, walking slowly towards Waya. – But still, if you make one more mistake, one such scene again, I swear that I will skin you alive and use it for frightening the spirits at night!

With no more than an irritated mumble, the hunter turned on his heels and quickly ran down the hill towards their bivouac. Kinunote followed him, looking exhausted and nauseous, fighting the scenes of skinned Waya that his mind was still playing behind his eyelids. Toke slipped dramatically his knife across her throat, slightly and delicately, causing minimal damage but a lot of pain. And then vanished into thin air. The woman quickly grabbed her neck with her free hand and inhaled as deep as she could. Her hands were trembling, and eyes burning with spite and hate but still, she managed to pull herself together and stand up from the ground. She said nothing whatsoever, like she had suddenly lost her voice.

&#150; Mistake. – Atsila whispered rather to herself than to Sequoyah after the witch was also out of sight. – That was a mistake. We should have killed her. 

&#150; Why? – he asked quickly, too absent-mindedly while making plans for an escape inside his head. 

&#150; There is something odd about her. Dangerous. I feel like she will drag us into hell with her.

But what if that is where we belong?

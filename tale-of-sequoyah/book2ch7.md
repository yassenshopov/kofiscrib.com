# BOOK 2: The Journey
## Chapter 7: The Plan

Atsila decided to remain silent the whole following day. She had absolutely no desire to speak to anybody after what happened last night, her thoughts so damn occupied with replaying every scene again and again that her brain would simply stop functioning if she had to think about something else. The bruise on her cheek was hurting like crazy – a low cut right below her left eye, but her absent mind was barely registering it. Her only desire was to sleep and sleep forever. It was all too much to handle – the gift or curse she carried, the spirits all around them, the crazy woman that idolized her… and finally her upcoming death. Her end was near, and she could sense it. She could smell doom in the air, dense and hot – unbreathable, making the hairs on her neck stand. 

The truth is she was afraid. Terrified. Mortified. Behind every tree, in every shadow, with every move, she saw that same wolf and its long canines on her neck. The knife pressed against her throat. The spirit catching her body and torturing her soul until it vanishes with agony. Either that or the crazy witch would drag her yet again in the forest, taking her away from her sleep. Oh, what a terror she felt when she woke up abruptly with a hand on her mouth, her bare feet touching the damp ground, being dragged way faster than she could ever imagine through the wild. For a moment, while biting her way to freedom out of that woman’s terribly tight grip, Atsila thought she would never be found. That Sequoyah wouldn’t find her or wouldn’t take the risk to go that deep inside the forest for her. The thought alone that she would be lost inside this wild place with only the witch was making her shiver whole like she was feverish. 
 
And still, Sequoyah was there with her. He found her. He rescued her and took her to her safe place again. Actually, he was her safe place now. With all the wild creatures around, with all the people that wanted to take advantage of her in one way or another… he was the only one she knew would protect her. Until he had to kill her. How ironic it was, when she chose him as her killer, she did it just because she wanted to see his face one more time, to die looking at a familiar face – a face she had loved all her life. And now that the time for her sacrifice marched fast towards her, she wanted to escape him. To escape the selfish decision she had made that day and not bring all the guilt and trauma upon him. She wanted to protect the one she had always secretly admired and loved and still, was failing miserably so far. The fear, the confusion, the constant visions she was having every night were all boiling inside of her making her a pathetic, scared version of herself that was always returning to her initial desire – to die by the hands of her beloved, to see his eyes once more before her spirit goes upwards or downwards to the roots of hell…

The end of her consciousness was soon, too soon. She wanted to scream, to cry and run far, far away from here…

&#150; Are you alright? – a gentle voice snapped her out of her dark thoughts.

*No, I am not.*

&#150; Yes. – an outright lie. 

Sequoyah looked at her suspiciously but didn’t push it any further. He knew better than everyone that convincing her into talking was rarely working and the confessions were always weighing heavy in the air around them. Nobody needed that now. 

After everything that had happened - after the wolf attack, after her almost successful abduction and all the chants about her being “the Priestess”, all she could think about when she met his eyes was how deeply ashamed she was when he looked at her bare face. He had never seen her without her face paint. Without her mask, her shield she was almost naked. So vulnerable. Not that she hadn’t been vulnerable in front of him but still, it was new to her. All the women in the tribe applied face paint and marks around their body resembling the nature cycles and it was an obligatory thing to do that she grew up doing. Now it was almost like one of her legs was missing when she wasn’t wearing any paint. 
 
&#150; Toke, set the fire. – Onakona’s voice reached the core of her brain, making her realize that the whole afternoon had passed without her noticing. – Kinunote, tie the witch to that tree.

They were setting the bivouac for tonight, wanting to keep Waya close but not too close to them. Her tree was not far away – they could still hear her prayers and chants, her constant mumbling and singing songs to the gods, worshiping the Priestess, thanking them for bringing her here. Atsila was feeling sick to the bones by her words, so sick that she wished to take a knife and kill the woman in her sleep. Or maybe leave her to the wolves in the forest that were initially following her. The girl couldn’t exactly explain why but everything this witch was, was repelling her, making her terribly, unfathomably angry and afraid at the same time. 

&#150; I can cut her tongue off if you like. – Sequoyah tried to cheer her up a little but failed miserably. – Atsila, please, talk to me.

They were sitting near the campfire, two small rabbits baking on top of it. Toke was out there in the wild searching for more, while Kinunote was drawing something strange on a hard leaf using only mud. Sometimes they were all forgetting the fact that he was still a boy, only three years difference between them with Sequoyah. Yes, married but still a boy.

Onakona was sitting unusually quiet at the other side of the fire, surprisingly not bothering anyone but his eyes preying, searching, scanning the surroundings while listening carefully to every sound, either human or inhuman.
 
&#150; I… - the girl tried talking but her throat was still sore from shouting. – I am going to die soon. I feel it. 

Sequoyah’s eyes quickly became distant, cold and harsh and she could feel the way he was sliding back inside his shell. 

&#150; No, please. – Atsila begged him quietly, forcing herself to look him in the eyes, but when she turned her head, he had already looked away. – Please, look at me. I need to say it.

No reaction.

&#150; Please, look at me. Look at me, love.

The last word simply slipped through her mouth, coming out as naturally as breathing, but she didn’t say anything to mask it up. She was sure he had guessed it by now somehow, her feelings for him were quite obvious for everybody. The thing is she never really imposed them on him. Never wanted to be another pressure to the already long list so she kept quiet. Now that she felt the cold hands of death grabbing her by the shoulders, caressing her face and slowly but steadily choking her, she didn’t have the desire to filter her words, her actions, her feelings.

His stare was somehow afraid when his eyes met hers. He looked like he was pitying her, mourning her already, fearing for her fate as much as she did at that moment, and even though his pity was the last thing she sought, she swallowed her pride and simply said:
 
&#150; I feel that I will die soon. We are getting closer. And I’m growing more and more afraid with each day. 

The boy right next to her looked around a few times, his motions restless and obviously uneasy in unison with his thoughts. 

&#150; I… - he doubted midsentence but decided to continue with what he intended to say. – I think I have a plan.

&#150; A plan? For what?

Another tense silence and his eyes quickly moved to his feet, to the ground.

&#150; I don’t want to lose you, Atsila. – he admitted sounding dull and hollow, exhausted to the bones. – I am trying to think of a way to get you out of this, but I don’t know if I will make it better or not.

&#150; What do you mean? We do not have a way out.

Sequoyah’s lips were pressed into a tight line and without much more than a nod, he showed the girl the place where the old woman was sleeping right at that moment, her leg tied to a tree. Atsila immediately shivered, terror running down her spine.  

*No, he can’t be thinking what I think he’s thinking. This cannot be*, she feverishly murmured to herself but then quickly shut up, aware of Onakona’s spying eyes and ears. 

She looked at the young hunter with disapproval and hugged her knees, trying to calm down the panic that was shaking her whole body with convulses. Atsila had no idea what he was actually thinking but didn’t really want to know. Anything involving the witch was something she was not willing to do.

&#150; No. – her answer was definitive, leaving no space for doubt that she would not want to hear anything else related to that woman.

&#150; I know it may sound insane, but I think… - Sequoyah started whispering aggressively but was quickly interrupted:

&#150; No. Not a word more. 

And without hesitating, she stood up from her warm place to the fire and laid right beside her travel bag, on a messy fur she had left there for a bed tonight. Her mind was already busy enough to be occupied with plans on how to run even deeper inside the forest. The sole thought about that was making her sick with fear, so deep and intense that she felt her chest hurting. She would rather die quickly by the hand of Sequoyah than run to the wild and die slowly, circled by hostility and endless agony…

The sleep came easy to her that night. Maybe because it was carrying a message again.
